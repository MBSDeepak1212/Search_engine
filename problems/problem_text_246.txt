 On the occasion of an event Chef was called as a chief guest. The auditorium was filled with males (M) and females (F), occupying one chair each. Our Chef is very curious guy, so he asks the gatekeeper some queries. The queries were as follows: Is there any K*K sub-matrix in the auditorium which contains all Males or Females.
