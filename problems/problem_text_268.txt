Only a few centuries later, the Berland government realized what was necessary for the country's prosperity. That's right, a dakimakura for every resident of Berland!It is known that Berland consists of NNN cities, where CiCiC_i people live in city iii and it takes TiTiT_i hours to get from city iii to city i+1i+1i + 1.The government is ready to allocate xxx tugriks for the implementation of the project to give out dakimakuras. They also agreed with local producers, so the dakimakuras themselves are free.To implement the project, the government can open a branch for issuing dakimakuras free of charge in several cities. For each city with an open branch for issuing dakimakuras, the government can pay 111 tugrik to increase its productivity by 111 unit. It can be increased any number of times, so that a productivity of kkk units costs kkk tugriks.Then the issuance of dakimakuras begins. For each resident of the country that is located in city iii, he/she will travel to the first city with index greater or equal to iii that has a branch. Recall, it takes TiTiT_i hours to travel from city iii to i+1i+1i+1. After arrival, he/she enters the queue in the branch.For each branch, it handles the queue as follows.Let the productivity of this branch be ppp. If there are less than ppp people in the queue, then the branch issues dakimakuras to everyone in the queue. Otherwise, it starts with the first ppp people, and gives them dakimakuras. A branch can only give dakimakuras every hour (that is, integer times since the start). Also, a resident cannot receive a dakimakura at the same moment he/she enters the queue.You must find the minimum amount of time required for the government to issue dakimakuras to all residents of Berland, spending no more than xxx tugriks in total. Assume all the residents start travelling at the same time, and the branches also opened at hour 000.
