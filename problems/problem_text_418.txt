 So, he decided to play an android game similar to cricket but this game is a little different from what the actual game is. In this game, there is an N*M matrix(field) and some players are randomly standing in the matrix to block the ball and stop the game. The ball starts to move from the first row and it can move either diagonally or vertically in the next row. Any movement in the same row or to the previous row is restricted. Considering the distance between any two rows as one unit, Yuvraj has to tell the maximum number of units (vertical row-wise distance) the ball can travel.For example let # be the players and 0 be free path in the below matrix :-0 # 0 00 # # ## 0 # #0 # # ## # 0 #In this matrix, a player starting from first row first column can at maximum, go upto 4 rows.
