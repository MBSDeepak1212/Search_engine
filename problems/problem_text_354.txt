 The distance from A to B is the total minimum penalty incurred in converting A to B using the following operations, each of which incurs a penalty as described below.Replacing a digit of A with another digit: incurs a penalty of 1Inserting a digit in A: incurs a penalty of 1 for each digit inserted. In addition, there is also a fixed penalty of x for every sequence of digits inserted (one-time penalty for starting the sequence, not per-digit). However, the total penalty charged for a sequence of digits inserted never exceeds y (y > x). For example, if x = 2 and y = 5, then inserting a one digit sequence (say \xe2\x80\x9c5\xe2\x80\x9d) will incur a penalty of 3 (=x+1), a 2-digit sequence (say \xe2\x80\x9c24\xe2\x80\x9d) will incur a penalty of 4 (=x+2), and inserting any n-digit sequence (n > 2) (say \xe2\x80\x9c132\xe2\x80\x9d, 2543\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9c57241\xe2\x80\x9d etc.) will all incur a penalty of 5 (=y).Deleting a digit from A: incurs a penalty of 1 for each digit deleted. In addition, there is also a fixed penalty of x for every sequence of digits deleted (one-time penalty for starting the sequence, not per-digit).What is the minimum penalty with which A can be converted to B?
