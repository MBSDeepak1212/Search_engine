 Chef being  small,  can\xe2\x80\x99t buy colours or guns on his own. So, his elder sister Chefina was given the task of buying those colours and other stuff and distribute them between Chef and herself. But Chefina proved to be a mischiveous.She wants an answer from Chef and in return she will give Chef his part of the colours and water guns provided Chef gives the correct answer.The question Chefina asks Chef is in the form of a string of digits which is manipulated as follow: In the chosen string Chefina changed perfect square digits 444 and 999 with the square root of these numbers written twicetwicetwice simultaneously instead of them. For example if string is \xe2\x80\x9814\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x9814\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x9814\xe2\x80\x99  then chefina gives \xe2\x80\x98122\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x98122\xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\x98122\xe2\x80\x99  to chef.So Chef\xe2\x80\x99s work is to count thepossible number of strings that Chefina might have used to make up the manipulated string in the question.But since Chef is a small child he gives this work to you and asks for your help. Your task is to help Chef get his share of colours.Also since this number can be quite large, tell Chef instead its remainder when divided by 109+7109+710^9+7.Print 000 if chefina gave a faulty manipulated string of digits.
