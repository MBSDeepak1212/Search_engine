 You are also given QQQ ordered pairs of integers, where the iii-th pair is denoted (xi,yi)(xi,yi)(x_i, y_i).A subsequence of AAA, say [Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aik][Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aik][A_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \\ldots, A_{i_k}], is said to be magical if the following condition is satisfied:For each 1\xe2\x89\xa4j<k1\xe2\x89\xa4j<k1 \\leq j \\lt k, (Aij,Aij+1)(Aij,Aij+1)(A_{i_j}, A_{i_{j+1}}) must be among the given QQQ pairs. That is, each consecutive pair of elements in this subsequence must be among the given QQQ pairs.Find the length of the longest magical subsequence of AAA, and print the indices of one such longest subsequence. If there are multiple longest magical subsequences, you may print the indices of any of them.Note: Array contains at least one valid subsequence of length greater than or equal to 222.
