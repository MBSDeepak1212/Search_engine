 There are NNN cubes placed in a straight line numbered 111 through NNN. The iii-th cube has a point PiPiP_i associated with it. Each player takes alternate turns and proceeds as follows -If only a single cube is left, player picks it. Otherwise, he/she tosses an unbiased coin. If the coin lands on heads, player takes the first cube otherwise they take the last cube.What is the expected total points Chef will get if he goes first?Note: The unbiased coin lands on heads with probability 0.5 (and hence lands on tails with the same probability). Also, the total point is the sum of points of all cubes that Chef will get.
