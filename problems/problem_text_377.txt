You are given a tree with NNN nodes numbered 111 through NNN. Each node is initially colored white. We perform the following process on this tree:choose an unordered pair of vertices (a,b)(a,b)(a, b) uniformly at random (i.e. each pair has an equal probability of being picked)if there is a black node on the shortest path between aaa and bbb (including aaa and bbb), the process stopsotherwise:all nodes on this path are colored blackthen, go back to the first stepWhat is the expected number of times the process returns to the first step until it ends? It can be proved that this number may be represented as a fraction P/QP/QP/Q, where PPP and QQQ are coprime integers and Q\xe2\x89\xa00Q\xe2\x89\xa00Q \eq 0 modulo 998244353998244353998244353. Compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot Q^{-1} modulo 998244353998244353998244353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921Q^{-1} denotes the inverse of QQQ modulo 998244353998244353998244353.
