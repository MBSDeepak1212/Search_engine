 Initially there are N diamonds placed in a straight line. Diamonds numbered from 1 to N in consecutive order. Each diamond has a specific value. The value of i-th diamond is Vi for i from 1 to N. Players make moves alternatively. In each move player proceeds as follows. If there is only one diamond left the player takes it otherwise he/she tosses the unbiased coin and if it lands on heads he/she takes the first diamond among the diamonds that are currently present in a line, otherwise he/she takes the last diamond. What is the expected total value Alice will get, if she plays first? Note that the unbiased coin lands on heads with probability 0.5 (and hence lands on tail with the same probability). Also note that the total value is the sum of values of all diamonds that Alice will get.
