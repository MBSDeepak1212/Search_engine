 This map is called The Tree Map. In this map NNN rooms are connected to each other in the form of a Tree.The game starts with NNN players where you are the Imposter and other N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 players are Crewmates. Your task is to kill crewmates without getting caught. There is 111 crewmate in each room except the one in which you are.Before the game starts, the crewmates can block any one room and you are free to choose any unblocked room from where you start. Being an imposter you cannot travel through or to the blocked room.You don't want to be suspicious so you have decided to kill the crewmate who is farthest from the room you start the game. To kill a crewmate you have to visit the room in which the crewmate is present.    You are given QQQ queries and in each query you are given the room number for the blocked room. Your task is to find the number of rooms to travel in order to kill a crewmate (of course the farthest one to avoid being suspicious) when only the given room is blocked.
