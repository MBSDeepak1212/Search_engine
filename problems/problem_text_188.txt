Why?Because of the top prize for the contest, a limited edition kitchen knife.But to win the contest she must calculate the values f(M, N, X) of the function named polynomial partition function.The polynomial partition function f(M, N, X) is defined bywhere P is a given polynomial P(x) = CD \xc2\xb7 xD + CD-1 \xc2\xb7 xD-1 + ... + C1 \xc2\xb7 x + C0.For example,f(1, 3, X) = P(3X)f(2, 3, X) = P(0) P(3X) + P(X) P(2X) + P(2X) P(X) + P(3X) P(0) = 2 P(X) P(2X) + 2 P(0) P(3X)f(3, 1, X) = P(0) P(0) P(X) + P(0) P(X) P(0) + P(X) P(0) P(0) = 3 P(0)2 P(X)Ciel is a great chef. However, she is not very good at arithmetic. So she needs your help to make her win the contest.For the given values of P, M, N and X, your work is to calculate the value of f(M, N, X).The answer can be very large, so you should print the answer modulo 1000000007 (109+7), that is, you need to find the remainder of division of f(M, N, X) by 1000000007 (109+7).
