Let (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) represent the cell in the iii-th row from the top and the jjj-th column from the left. If you are currently at cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j), you can:move one cell down to (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i + 1, j)move one cell right to (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i, j + 1)The cost of a path is defined as the number of times you move between two cells that have different colours.You are given QQQ queries. In the iii-th query, you are initially at (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1) and want to reach (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi)(X_i, Y_i) with the minimum cost.For each query, before you begin, you can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):Choose a column and flip the colour of all cells in this column (i.e. change the colour of all the black cells to white and the colour of all the white cells to black in this column)For each query, what is the minimum cost of a path from (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1) to (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi)(X_i, Y_i) after performing this operation any number of times (possibly zero)?Note: The operations applied in different queries are independent of each other.
