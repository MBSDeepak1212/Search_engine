 There is a parameter energy associated with each empty box, denoted by Ei. He wants to move each stone into some box. After moving all the stones into the boxes, he wants to compute the total energy of box/stone system. For that he believes that a contribution of box into energy of the system can be computed as follows. If box i contains s stones and there are total k boxes out there containing more than s stones, then contribution of box i into the system of energy will be given by Ei \xc3\x97 k.Sereja wants the box/stone system to be most stable, i.e. it should have least possible energy. Find out minimum possible energy of this system.
