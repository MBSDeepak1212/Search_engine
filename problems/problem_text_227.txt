Chef is playing a card game called Blackjack. He starts with a deck of NNN cards (numbered 111 through NNN), where for each valid iii, the iii-th card has an integer AiAiA_i written on it. Then he starts dealing the cards one by one in the order from card 111 to card NNN. Chef wins if at some moment in time, the sum of all the cards dealt so far is between XXX and YYY inclusive; if this never happens, Chef loses.We want Chef to win the game, so without him noticing, we will swap some pairs of cards (possibly none) before the game starts. Find the smallest number of swaps we need so that Chef would win the game, or determine that it is impossible to make Chef win.
