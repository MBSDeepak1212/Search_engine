His strategy is as follows -When any member of his clan member will attack at any member of the enemy\'s clan then the attacker\'s army will consist of only two types of troops - Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P"(as these two are the mightiest troops),The attacker\'s army should be balanced, i.e., if the attacker\'s army consists of N troops then in any continuous section of the army the difference between the number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds must be atmost 2.An army will be represented as a string of Lava Hounds "L" and P.E.K.K.A. "P".Example : If the army consists of N=5 troops, then there are 14 possible combinations for a balanced army ( condition number 2 ). The Lexicographical Order of this is - LLPLP, LLPPL, LPLLP, LPLPL, LPLPP, LPPLL, LPPLP, PLLPL, PLLPP, PLPLL, PLPLP, PLPPL, PPLLP and PPLPL.All the possible balanced combinations of army of a certain length N can be ordered lexicographically with index starting from 1. Example for N=5, army at number 7 is LPPLP (see in the above example).Since the leader is busy in donating the troops to his clan members therefore he needs your help in finding the number(index) assigned to an army for a given value of N(number of P.E.K.K.A. and Lava Hounds in army).There can be large number of such possible combinations for a particular value of N therefore output the result modulo M.\xc2\xa0
