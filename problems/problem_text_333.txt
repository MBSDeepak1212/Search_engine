Heavy-light decomposition is to be built on a rooted tree. In this problem, the node with the number 1 should be considered the root of a tree. Heavy light decomposition is a colouring of edges of the tree. Each edge is either heavy or light. For each non leaf node (node having degree greater than 1), from all the edges emanating from it into the subtree rooted at this vertex should have exactly one heavy edge. The heavy-light decomposition is called correct, if you can reach any node from the root node by using no more that \xe2\x8c\x8a log2 N \xe2\x8c\x8b light edges, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.Given a tree, calculate the number of its' correct heavy-light decompositions. As answer could be very large, please print it modulo 19101995.
