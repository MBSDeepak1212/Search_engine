 Fluffy can give the robot a command of length k, which consists of the letters R, L, D or U. The top left square is (1, 1) while the bottom right square is (n, m). If the robot receives a command R, then it moves one square to the right. Similarly, U, D, L stands for up, down and left respectively.Some squares of the grid are filled with lava, which will melt the robot if it ever goes into that square. So, a sequence of command is called valid if the robot never moves into a square filled with lava or outside the grid. For each square (x, y), Fluffy wants to know the number of valid commands that will take the robot there. Can you help him?\xc2\xa0
