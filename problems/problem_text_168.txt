 Please read NOTE if you are not familiar with XOR operation. XOR-sum of a list of numbers is the result of XOR-ing all of them. XOR-sum of (A[1] XOR A[2] XOR ... XOR A[N]) is defined as A[1] XOR (A[2] XOR (A[3] XOR ( ... XOR A[N]))).Apart of that, Polo, the Penguin, likes trees. He has a weighted tree consisting of N vertices.He also likes to choose some pair of vertices U and V and find XOR-sum of all weights on the simple path from U to V. Help him to find the maximal number he can get .
