 So he started his own farm of herbs, where he would grow his own herbs. Right now, he has NNN different herbs in a row on his farm. He was getting bored, so he came up with a challenging problem for you:You are allowed to divide the NNN herbs into non-empty groups by creating some partitions (possibly zero) between the herbs such that each group contains at most MMM herbs. Your task is to find the number of distinct groupings. Since the answer can be large, print it modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.Note: Two groupings are considered distinct ifBoth contain a different number of groups, else ifThe ithithi^{th} groups (from the left) for both groupings contain different numbers of herbs.
