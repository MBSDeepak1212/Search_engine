Harry is very anxious about the house sorting ceremony which is about to take place.The headmaster of the school, Albus Dumbledore has introduced a new way of sorting the students .For every student, Dumbledore will create a special string SSS out of his magic and each student has to create his/her own special string PPP with the help of the magic wand.The sorting hat will sort the students into their favourite house if their string PPP is charming with Dumbledore\xe2\x80\x99s string SSS, otherwise the students will be sorted into the house which they hate the most.A string PPP is charming with string SSS if the string SSS has an even number of substrings which are twin strings of PPP. String TTT is a Twin of string PPP if the magic power of both the strings are  equal.The magic power of a string is defined as the sum of powers of each alphabet in a string.The power of a alphabet is its respective position in the first 26 alphabets i.e; power  of \xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99b\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99c\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99k\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99z\xe2\x80\x99 are 1,2,3,11,26 respectively.Now Harry\xe2\x80\x99s wish is to be sorted into GRYFFINDOR and also he can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine being sorted to SLYTHERIN.Given the special string of Harry and Dumbledore, help Harry determine the house he will be sorted into.
