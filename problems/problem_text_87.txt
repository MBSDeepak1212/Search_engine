To heal people with virus infections, Ada designed small robots (nanobots) that travel through the bloodstream, scanning all tissues of the body.The nanobots have detected a region of infected cells described by a matrix with NNN rows (numbered 11 through NN from top to bottom) and NN columns (numbered 11 through NN from left to right). For each valid rr and cc, the cell in row rr and column cc has a membrane with thickness Tr,cT_{r,c}.To prevent the spread of the virus, the nanobots surrounded the infected region and decided to destroy all the infected cells. The nanobots can form a powerful laser with force FF and shoot this laser horizontally from the left or from the right of any row, or vertically from the top or from the bottom of any column. Whenever the laser is fired, it breaks through the maximum number of cells in its way such that the total thickness of these cells' membranes is less than or equal to FF and destroys them; the cells that lie behind them are unaffected. Formally, if the laser destroys CC cells, then they are the first CC cells which lie in the laser's way (from the direction in which it is fired), haven't been destroyed before, and the sum of thicknesses of their membranes is at most FF.The laser may be fired multiple times from any directions in any rows or columns. It may also be fired repeatedly in the same direction and the same row or column. However, each shot uses a lot of the nanobots' energy, so Ada wants to destroy all cells using as few shots as possible.Let HH be the minimum number of shots needed to destroy all cells when using only horizontal shots, and VV the minimum number of shots needed to destroy all cells when using only vertical shots. Ada programmed the nanobots to perform K=min(V,H)K = \\mathrm{min}(V,H) shots. Help Ada write a program that uses a strictly smaller number of shots.
