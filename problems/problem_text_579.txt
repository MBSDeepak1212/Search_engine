 This list in infinite. We know that Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. So in this list each number apart from first two, is sum of previous two numbers modulo 1013.ex : (a+b)mod 1013.So beginning of the list looks like : 0,\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x891,\xe2\x80\x892,\xe2\x80\x893,\xe2\x80\x895,\xe2\x80\x898,\xe2\x80\x8913,\xe2\x80\x8921,\xe2\x80\x89...Now you're given an integer n, find first occurrence of n in the given list. (0-indexed)
