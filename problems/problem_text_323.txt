  He was taught first 20 letters of English alphabet and was asked to make words from these alphabets. Since he doesn\'t know many dictionary words, he quickly finished this work by making random strings from these alphabets.Now while other kids are busy creating their words, John gets curious and puts all the strings he created in a list and named it X.He picks two indices \'i\' and \'j\'  ( not necessarily distinct). He assigns A as X[i] and B as X[j]. He then concatenates both the strings to create a new string C ( = A + B ). He calls a string "super string" if that string contains all the 20 letters of English alphabet he has just learnt,atleast once.Given the strings of the list, can you tell him how many such unordered  pairs (i,j) he can choose such that string C is a super string. \xc2\xa0
