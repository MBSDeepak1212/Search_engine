Rishabh doesn't know programming. As a programmer you thought you could help him. The problem is that you have T intervals. From each interval you will pick one integer value(integer picked could be the boundary also). Now you are required to sum those values. For each integer Ni between N and N+X(both included), print the total number of ways in which these values can be picked so that the sum of values is equal to Ni. As this number of ways may be large, print your answer modulo 1000000007. In case no such way exist, print NO corresponding to the sum. Also note {1,2} is different from {2,1}.
