 He has labelled the problems from 1 to n. Fluffy the Squirrel has reviewed the problems, and assigned a difficulty rating di for each problem. The contest problems must have consecutive problem numbers. This means that the contest problems must have labels x, x + 1, ..., y for two positive  integers x and y. He believes a contest is balanced if there are at least l problems and at most r problems. Additionally, the average difficulty rating of the problems must be at most A. Flippy wants to set A to some real number (which means it might have decimal places) so that Fluffy can choose the problems for the contest in at least k ways, where k is a positive integer. Flippy wants A to be as small as possible. Find the optimal value of A.\xc2\xa0
