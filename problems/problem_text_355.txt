 Basically chef has NNN ingredients and each ingredient iii has a cost cicic_{i}.A topping for the pizza is prepared by taking at least MMM ingredients and the cost of making a topping is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum cost of the ingredient involved in making this topping. Each ingredient must be present in exactly one topping, and also it is not allowed to leave any ingredient.  Let the number of toppings prepared by the chef be XXX (1\xe2\x89\xa4X)(1\xe2\x89\xa4X)(1 \\leq X) following the above constraint and the cost of toppings be denoted by t1,t2,t3,....,txt1,t2,t3,....,txt1, t2, t3, ...., tx. The overall cost of the pizza is defined as the maximum of the cost of all such toppings i.e max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx)max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx)max(t1, t2, t3, ...., tx). Help the chef to find the minimum cost in which the pizza can be prepared i.e. you need to minimize max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx)max(t1,t2,t3,....,tx)max(t1, t2, t3, ...., tx).Note:You need to minimize the overall cost of the pizza, you don't need to maximize or minimize the cost of any topping or the number of toppings.
