 Formally, we define a geometric progression as a series of numbers, with a common ratio k, such that the sequence is of the form b*k0 , b*k1, b*k2,b*k3,b*k4 and so on.    Alternatively, we can define a Geometric Progression as a sequence of terms in which each succeeding term is obtained by multiplying its preceding term by a constant.We are given an array of N integers, and the value of K (common ratio). \xc2\xa0Find the number of triplets that can be formed from the array A, such that their common ratio is K.  i.e., Find the total number of possible distinct combinations of (i1,i2,i3) such that A[i1] , A[i2] , A[i3] are in GP and  1\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89i1\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89i2\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89i3\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89N
