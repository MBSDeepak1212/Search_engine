 So Chef decided to meet up with Unacademy. Chef was sure Unacademy will support him for eternity. But as tradition goes Unac from  Unacademy presented the following welcome task for Chef to solve.  Unac gave Chef a magical sequence of NNN numbers [m1,m2,m3,......mN][m1,m2,m3,......mN][m_1,m_2,m_3,......m_N]. The given sequence is magical because sum of this sequence is at most 300300300. Chef has to choose a special sequence of numbers [a1,a2,a3,a4,.......aN][a1,a2,a3,a4,.......aN][ a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,.......a_N]. Each element of this special sequence must belong to the set {\xe2\x88\x921,0,1}{\xe2\x88\x921,0,1}\\{-1,0,1\\}.Unac gave Chef two more numbers SSS and KKK. Chef has to find total no. of solutions of the following equation modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.a1\xe2\x88\x97m1+a2\xe2\x88\x97m2+a3\xe2\x88\x97m3+.............+aN\xe2\x88\x97mN=Sa1\xe2\x88\x97m1+a2\xe2\x88\x97m2+a3\xe2\x88\x97m3+.............+aN\xe2\x88\x97mN=Sa_1*m_1+a_2*m_2+a_3*m_3+.............+a_N*m_N = S.There can be  atmost  KKK numbers in special sequence with value  "\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921-1". Right now Chef is busy with home shifting. So he asked you to find total number of solutions of the equation given by Unac modulo 100000000710000000071000000007 (109+7109+710^9 + 7).
