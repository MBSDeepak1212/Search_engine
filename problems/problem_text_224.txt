\xc2\xa0Sereja has an array A that contains n integers, namely A1, A2, ..., An. A single action consists of performing one of two following operations:To swap two consecutive elements;To make a random and uniform shuffle of all the elements of the array A.Now Sereja's goal is to make the expected value of the function f(A) as minimal as possible, by doing no more than k actions.The function f(A) is the minimal number of consecutive elements' swaps you need in order to sort the array A in the increasing order.What is the expected value of f(A) in case Sereja uses no more than k actions in the optimal way?
