You are given a character parenthesis array and an integer array.You need to find the maximum sum sub-array in the integer array such that the corresponding sub-array in the character array has balanced parenthesis.  Formally, a balanced parentheses is subset of  { [,],{,},<,>,(,) }\xe2\x88\x97 defined recursively as follows: The empty string is balanced parentheses.
