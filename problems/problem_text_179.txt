You are given a tree with NNN nodes rooted at node 111, and your task is to color each node of the tree either white or black. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N), let wiwiw_i be the number of white nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ithithi^{th} node and bibib_i be the number of black nodes that occurs in a simple path from the root node to ithithi^{th} node. The cost of a node iii is defined as the absolute difference between wiwiw_i and bibib_i. The cost of the tree is defined as the summation of the cost of all the nodes in the tree. The value of the tree is defined as the absolute difference between the total number of white nodes and the total number of black nodes in the tree. You have to color the tree in such a way that the cost of the tree is minimized.Your task is to answer a single query QQQ, such that:If Q=1Q=1Q = 1, Determine the maximum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.If Q=2Q=2Q = 2, Determine the minimum value the tree can have after minimizing the cost of the tree.
