In an undirected unweighted graph, an edge of the graph is said to be lucky if it is a part of some cycle of the graph.You are given a list E of M edges. We define f(i) as the number of intervals [l, r] (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 l \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 r \xe2\x89\xa4 M) such that if you build a graph from edges El, El+1, ..., Er, the edge Ei will be a lucky edge in this graph.Your task is to calculate the values of f(1), f(2), ..., f(M).
