Chef defined amazingness of a number n as follows. Let array a denote the decimal representation of n.amazingness of n is defined by following pseudo code.amazingness(a){    set s;    int ans = 0;    for ( int i = 0; i < a.length(); i++ ) {         int val = 0;         for ( int j = i; j < a.length(); j++ ) {            val ^= a[j];              // a[j] denotes digit at j-th (0-based indexing) position of n counting  from most signficant digit (left to right).            if (val not present in set s before) {                 ans += val;                 add val to set s            }         }   }   return ans;}Given two integers L, R. Find out the following sum : amazingnessL + amazingnessL + 1 + ... + amazingnessR. As the answer could be large, print your answer modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007)
