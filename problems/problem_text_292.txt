There is an infinite sheet of paper and a pen. At any time, the pen may be placed above a point (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) on the paper or touching it at a point (x,y)(x,y)(x, y); in both cases, we call the point (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) the position of the pen. The initial position of the pen is (0,0)(0,0)(0, 0).You may perform the following types of actions:move the pen down until it touches the paperlift the pen (if it was touching the paper); after this action, the pen is not touching the papermove the pen from its current position (x,y)(x,y)(x, y) to (x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x\xe2\x88\x921,y)(x-1, y) or (x+1,y)(x+1,y)(x+1, y)move the pen from its current position (0,y)(0,y)(0, y) to (0,y+1)(0,y+1)(0, y+1)Actions of the first two types take no time, an action of the third type takes 111 second and an action of the fourth type takes 111 second. Each action may be performed any number of times. You may only move the pen for at most PPP seconds in total.Whenever the pen is moved from (x1,y1)(x1,y1)(x_1, y_1) to (x2,y2)(x2,y2)(x_2, y_2) while touching the paper, it draws a line segment between these points (inclusive). Drawing over a line segment repeatedly is allowed.You are given NNN special line segments; each of them is parallel with the xxx-axis. A special line segment is fully drawn if each point belonging to it also belongs to some drawn line segment. Your goal is to fully draw as many special line segments as possible in PPP seconds. How many can you fully draw?
