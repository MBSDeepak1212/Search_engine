 Now, let us assume that all the free locations in the campus can be represented as a Matrix of N * M. Each element of the matrix is an integer which denotes the level of satisfaction the admin will get by constructing a building at that point. For a building whose corner points can be denoted by the points (x, y), (x, w), (z, y) and (z, w) gives a satisfaction equals to sum of all values that it encloses within these four points.For example, consider the matrix: 1 2 3 42 3 4 53 4 5 6The satisfaction value for the building denoted by the end points (1, 2), (1, 4), (3, 2), (3, 4) is 2 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 36 But the admin is quite sceptical when constructing buildings and prefers to construct only those building which will provide a satisfaction S which follows the following rule. B = S mod A , where A and B are some integersNow the Admin wants to know, how many such buildings can be made which satisfies the above criterion ?\xc2\xa0
