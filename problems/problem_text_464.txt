 She is more concerned about process management than any other function of the OS. She has already designed algorithms but needs to check how efficient she is. You, as her test designer, are to design a benchmark application in order to determine efficiency for a particular set of processes.You are given an array of size N indicating the burst time of the processes. Any two processes with burst times A and B will combine as A+B mod 100 (can\xe2\x80\x99t help the calculation says it), and the time consumed to combine these is (A*B) (COUPLING TIME!). The Benchmark application is concerned in minimizing the COUPLING TIME.  Help Aditi to design the Benchmark application.
