Akhil is a professor at University of Alexia. This semester, he is taking a course on Algorithms. One day after teaching about palindrome and related algorithms, he gave the following task to his students. Students found it very easy and solved it quickly. Can you solve it too? You are given N strings. Each of them will have size equal to one or two, with their characters belonging to the character set {\xe2\x80\x98a\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x99b\xe2\x80\x99}. You have to delete minimum number of strings from the above given strings such that the string obtained after concatenating the remaining strings (in the original order of appearance in the N strings) is a palindrome. Find out the minimum number of deletions required.
