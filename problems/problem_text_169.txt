The Professor is going on a trip with his family this weekend. The country where they live is a federation of NNN states (numbered 111 through NNN) with RRR bidirectional interstate roads connecting them. For each road, we know the amount of fuel the Professor needs to traverse it; travelling within a state consumes no fuel. For each iii, the price of fuel in state iii is fixed at FiFiF_i units of money per litre.Despite Professor's outstanding talent and his great scientific prowess, he has some bad habits as well: he is too penny-wise, so he carries huge barrels in his car in order to store extra petrol and avoid buying petrol in expensive states. Therefore, he is able to carry any amount of fuel he wants at any moment during the trip, and he is also fine with visiting the same state more than once on the trip if it saves him money. The Professor starts the trip without any fuel.Help the Professor find the minimum possible amount of money he should spend on fuel in order to travel from state PPP to state QQQ.
