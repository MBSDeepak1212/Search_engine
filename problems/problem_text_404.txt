Roger is the mayor of a city with NNN citizens (numbered 111 through NNN). On each day, each citizen has to pay a tax; let's denote the tax paid by the iii-th citizen by AiAiA_i.One day, Roger was extremely bored, so he decided to start a return-tax-for-fun program. The program is simple: on each day, Roger picks some non-empty group of citizens and returns to them the taxes they paid that day. However, picking some random citizens is not very fun, and Roger has always been fond of the number KKK and its multiples, so he decided to only pick groups of citizens such that the product of the taxes returned to them is a multiple of KKK. Among all such choices, he picks a group which minimises the sum of the returned taxes (he does not want to waste too much money).We know that Roger is a moody person. Sometimes, he chooses two integers 1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le L \\le R \\le N and decides that he will not consider the citizens numbered LLL through RRR for the return-tax-for-fun program, i.e. the sum of returned taxes should be the smallest possible among all groups that do not contain any of these citizens. Roger told Melanie, his secretary, to do all the work and report to him the smallest sum of taxes that should be returned. Now, Melanie is looking for your help.You should answer QQQ queries. In each query, you are given the integers LLL and RRR and you should compute the smallest sum of taxes that should be returned or determine that there is no way to choose a group of citizens such that the product of the taxes returned to them is a multiple of KKK. Note that the queries are independent \xe2\x80\x94 a citizen that is not considered for the return-tax-for-fun program in one query may be considered for the program again in subsequent queries.
