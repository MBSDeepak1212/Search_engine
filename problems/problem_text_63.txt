Chef is trying to open the oven in his kitchen to cook some cookies. However, the oven is special \xe2\x80\x95 you need a password to open it.Let\'s define a function f(x)f(x)f(x) for a positive integer xx as follows:Consider the decimal representation of xx (without leading zeros). Split it into the minimum number of contiguous subsequences of digits such that in each subsequence, all digits are identical.For each subsequence, look at its position in the original decimal representation of xx. Let\'s say that the most significant digit it contained was the ee-th digit, where e=0e=0 corresponds to the least significant digit of xx. For example, 388,822,442388,822,442 can be split into subsequences "3", "888", "22", "44", "2", where e=7e=7 for the sequence "888" and e=4e=4 for the sequence "22".The value of a subsequence which contains a digit dd repeated one or more times is d\xe2\x8b\x8510ed \\cdot 10^e.f(x)f(x) is the sum of values of these subsequences. For example, f(388,822,442)=3\xe2\x8b\x85108+8\xe2\x8b\x85107+2\xe2\x8b\x85104+4\xe2\x8b\x85102+2\xe2\x8b\x85100f(388,822,442) = 3 \\cdot 10^8 + 8 \\cdot 10^7 + 2 \\cdot 10^4 + 4 \\cdot 10^2 + 2 \\cdot 10^0.The oven has a screen which displays two long integers LL and RR (with NLN_L and NRN_R digits respectively, without leading zeros). The password is the sum of f(x)f(x) for each xx between LL and RR inclusive.Chef does not have a lot of time, so he asks for your help. Please find the password for the oven so that he can start cooking as fast as possible. Since this number could be very large, compute it modulo 109+710^9 + 7.
