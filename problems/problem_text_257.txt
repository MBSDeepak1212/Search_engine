You are given a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN) and a bag with NNN markers. There is an integer written on each marker; each of these integers is 000, 111 or 222. You must assign exactly one marker to each vertex.Let's define the unattractiveness of the resulting tree as the maximum absolute difference of integers written on the markers in any two vertices which are connected by an edge.Find the minimum possible unattractiveness of the resulting tree.
