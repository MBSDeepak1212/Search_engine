 The country is in the form of a 222-d grid and is divided into NNN rows and MMM columns, such that each cell of the grid can be considered to be a city. Each city is initially marked with either 0 or 1. Let city (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) (the city at the intersection of the ithithi^{th} row and jthjthj^{th} column) be marked with number CijCijC_{ij}. If a traveller is in the city (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), then If Cij=0Cij=0C_{ij} = 0 and j<Mj<Mj \\lt M, then the traveller moves to city (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i,j+1) and at the same time CijCijC_{ij} is changed to 111.If Cij=1Cij=1C_{ij} = 1 and i<Ni<Ni \\lt N, then the traveller moves to city (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i+1,j) and at the same time CijCijC_{ij} is changed to 000.If the traveller cannot make a move from a city (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), then this city is considered to be the destination of that traveller. Note that the marking (CijCijC_{ij}) of the destination cell is unchanged \xe2\x80\x94 please see the third sample test for an explained example.Each traveller starts their journey from city (1,1)(1,1)(1,1), and all travellers (apart from the first) start their journey only once the previous one has reached their destination. Find the destination city of the KKK-th traveller.
