Limak is a big grizzly bear who loves wrestling.He is going to participate in a coming tournament.There will be N = 2H bears participating in the tournament.Bears are numbered 1 through N and Limak has index 1.Each bear has a unique value xi representing his or her strength.The tournament is divided into H stages.In each stage bears are divided into pairs according to their indices (more info in the next paragraph).In each pair, the two bears fight with each other and one of them wins (there are no draws).The loser is eliminated, while the winner advances to the next stage.In each stage, the remaining bears are sorted by their initial index.Then, the first two bears are in one pair, next two are in the second pair, and so on.So in the first stage there are N/2 matches: one between bear 1 and bear 2, one between bear 3 and bear 4, and so on (the last match between bear N-1 and bear N).In the second stage, the winner of the fight between bear 1 and bear 2, will fight against the winner of the fight between bear 3 and bear 4, and so on.Usually, when two bears fight with each other, the one with greater strength wins.But grizzly bears aren\'t always honest and fair.In each match (no matter if he fights in it or not), Limak can bribe the referee and change the winner of this match.To avoid suspicion, he can do it only if the difference between strengths of the two bears doesn\'t exceed K.For example, let\'s say that K = 10.If two bears with strength 70 and 85 fight with each other, the one with strength 85 must win.But if their strengths are 70 and 78 (or e.g. 70 and 80), Limak can bribe the referee and then the bear with strength 70 wins \xe2\x80\x94 but obviously Limak doesn\'t have to bribe the referee and then the bear with greater strength automatically wins.What is the minimum number of times Limak has to bribe a referee, if he wants to win the tournament?Output -1 if he can\'t win.
