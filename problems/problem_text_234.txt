Each node is assigned a lowercase english alphabet between a to z (both included). Given two nodes AAA and BBB:Let LCA(A,B)LCA(A,B)LCA(A, B) denote the lowest common ancestor of nodes AAA and BBB.Let DIS(A,B)DIS(A,B)DIS(A,B) denote the string containing all the characters associated with the nodes in the same order as the shortest path from node AAA to node BBB (excluding the character associated to node BBB). Note that DIS(A,A)DIS(A,A)DIS(A,A) is an empty string.Chef needs to answer QQQ queries. Each query is of the type:UUU VVV: Given two integers UUU and VVV (1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\xe2\x89\xa4U,V\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\\leq U,V \\leq N), determine if there exists a concatenation of a non-empty subsequence of DIS(U,LCA(U,V))DIS(U,LCA(U,V))DIS(U,LCA(U,V)) and a non-empty subsequence of DIS(V,LCA(U,V))DIS(V,LCA(U,V))DIS(V,LCA(U,V)) such that it is a palindrome.
