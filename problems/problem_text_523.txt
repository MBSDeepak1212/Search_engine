 The persons and seats are numbered from 1 to N.The N people are ordered according to who chooses the seats first. In other words, person 1 is the first to seat, followed by person 2, then person 3, etc.In addition, the ith person has a preferred seat Si, a number from 1 to N, and a preferred direction Di, which is either left or right. This means that on the ith person's turn, he/she first checks seats Si if it is available. If it's available, then he/she sits there, otherwise he walks into the direction specified by Di and sits on the first seat available in that direction. It's possible that the ith person doesn't find an available seat at all; if that happens, that person fails to seat and simply leaves.You know their preferred seats [S1, S2, ..., SN], but you don't know their preferred directions [D1, D2, ..., DN]. So the problem is: how many assignments of preferred directions are there such that all N people successfully seat?
