 Let BBB be defined as an array of NNN integers such that for each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N:Bi=Ai\xe2\x88\x921Bi=Ai\xe2\x88\x921B_i = A_i - 1, if AiAiA_i is even.Bi=Ai+1Bi=Ai+1B_i = A_i + 1, if AiAiA_i is odd. You are given an array CCC of size 2\xe2\x8b\x85N2\xe2\x8b\x85N2 \\cdot N which is formed by taking all the elements of the arrays AAA and BBB and rearranging them.You need to find the number of distinct arrays AAA whose sum of elements is KKK, from which CCC can be obtained.Note: Two arrays XXX and YYY are considered to be distinct if there exists no rearrangement of XXX which is the same as YYY.Since the final answer can be very large, print the answer modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
