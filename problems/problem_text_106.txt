Chef recently learned about the classic Longest Increasing Subsequence problem. However, Chef found out that while the length of the longest increasing subsequence is unique, the longest increasing subsequence itself is not necessarily unique; for example, in the array [1, 3, 2, 4], there are two longest increasing subsequences: [1, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 4].Chef decided to investigate on this more, and now he has sufficient mastery in it that he was able to come up with a problem:Given an integer K, output an integer N and a permutation of the array [1, 2, ..., N] such that there are exactly K longest increasing subsequences. Chef also requires that 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100, otherwise he found the problem is too easy.In case there are multiple possible answers, any one will be accepted.
