Let's call a sequence with length KKK good if there are at most K2+1K2+1\\frac{K}{2} + 1 distinct elements in it. For example, the sequence (3,3,2,1,3)(3,3,2,1,3)(3, 3, 2, 1, 3) is good, since it contains 3\xe2\x89\xa452+13\xe2\x89\xa452+13 \\le \\frac{5}{2} + 1 distinct elements, while the sequence (1,4,8,8,2)(1,4,8,8,2)(1, 4, 8, 8, 2) is not good, since it contains 4>52+14>52+14 \\gt \\frac{5}{2} + 1 distinct elements.You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. You may perform any number of operations (including zero) on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose one element of the sequence and replace it by any integer you choose. You want all contiguous subsequences of the resulting sequence to be good. What is the smallest number of operations you need to perform to achieve this?
