 Transporting system works on heavy load shipment, so they have a scale of 10 kgs. Hence, the total weight being transported is rounded off to nearest multiple of 10. This determines your profit/loss in the following way.For example, suppose the total weight to be shipped is 25 kgs, then it scales up to 30 kgs and hence you make a profit on 5 kgs extra shown. But in the similar way, if total weight to be shipped is 23 kgs, it scales down to 20 kgs and you makes a loss.A transporter uses a package to store and ship contiguous boxes coming on a conveyor belt and due to budget constraints you are allowed to use at max K different packages. Contiguous boxes coming over the belt are clubbed in a package and then the trasporter weighs the package and asks for shipment fee applicable. Help yourself in finding, what's the maximum weight which you can show. For better understanding, see the sample test case.
