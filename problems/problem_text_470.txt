The nation of Islandia can be represented as an N\xc3\x97NN\xc3\x97NN \\times N grid. Let (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) denote the square at the iii-th row from the top and the jjj-th column from the left. A cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) is labelled 111 if it is land and 000 if it is water. Any two cells of the grid which share a side, and are both land are said to belong to the same island. Islandia holds two contests a year, the first at (xa,ya)(xa,ya)(x_a, y_a) and the second at (xb,yb)(xb,yb)(x_b, y_b). Ashish will need to travel from cell (xa,ya)(xa,ya)(x_a, y_a) to (xb,yb)(xb,yb)(x_b, y_b). To do so, he can perform a sequence of zero or more moves. In each move if he is at (xi,yi)(xi,yi)(x_i, y_i), he can perform one of two actions:Type 1: Move from (xi,yi)(xi,yi)(x_i, y_i) to some land cell (xj,yj)(xj,yj)(x_j, y_j) that lies on a different island at a cost of |xi\xe2\x88\x92xj|+|yi\xe2\x88\x92yj||xi\xe2\x88\x92xj|+|yi\xe2\x88\x92yj|| x_i - x_j | + | y_i - y_j |Type 2: Move from (xi,yi)(xi,yi)(x_i, y_i) to some land cell (xj,yj)(xj,yj)(x_j, y_j) that lies on the same island at a cost of 000.Let the beauty of a sequence of moves be the number of moves of type 111 while traveling from (xa,ya)(xa,ya)(x_a, y_a) to (xb,yb)(xb,yb)(x_b, y_b). We define the simple cost as the minimum cost of a sequence with beauty\xe2\x89\xa41beauty\xe2\x89\xa41\\mathrm{beauty} \\leq 1.Ashish wants to figure out the maximum beauty possible to go from (xa,ya)(xa,ya)(x_a,y_a) to (xb,yb)(xb,yb)(x_b, y_b) without exceeding the simple cost. However, Ashish only knows (xa,ya)(xa,ya)(x_a, y_a). Find the answer for every possible land cell (xb,yb)(xb,yb)(x_b, y_b).Note that we DO NOT need to minimize the cost of the trip, only maximize the beauty without exceeding the simple cost.
