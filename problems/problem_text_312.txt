 They decided to rent three bikes from a shop.The shop has NNN bikes, the iii-th of which has a mileage of MiMiM_i.Chef and friends decided that they would rent three distinct bikes i,j,ki,j,ki, j, k satisfying the following property:(Mi\xe2\x8a\x95Mj)&Mk=Mi\xe2\x8a\x95(Mj&Mk)(Mi\xe2\x8a\x95Mj)&Mk=Mi\xe2\x8a\x95(Mj&Mk)(M_i \\oplus M_j) \\mathbin{\\&} M_k = M_i \\oplus (M_j \\mathbin{\\&} M_k)where \xe2\x8a\x95\xe2\x8a\x95\\oplus denotes bitwise XOR and &&\\mathbin{\\&} denotes bitwise AND.Please help them find out the number of different ways in which they can select the bikes.Note that two ways are considered to be different if the ordered triples of indices (i,j,k)(i,j,k)(i, j, k) are distinct, so for example (1,2,3)(1,2,3)(1, 2, 3), (1,2,4)(1,2,4)(1, 2, 4) and (1,3,2)(1,3,2)(1, 3, 2) are all distinct even if the bikes are such that M1=M2=M3=M4=1M1=M2=M3=M4=1M_1 = M_2 = M_3 = M_4 = 1.
