 The rules of the game are very simple. The players have \xe2\x80\x8bn\xe2\x80\x8bn\xe2\x80\x8bn cards in a row. Each card contains a number that is not necessarily distinct. The players take turns, Kaneki moves first. During his turn, a player can take a single card: either the leftmost card in a row or the rightmost one. The game ends when there are no more cards. The player who has the maximum sum of numbers on his cards by the end of the game wins. If both are having the same score by the end tie will be there, but Kaneki loves Touka so Touka will be declared as the winner.Both players will play the game optimally.Saitama is a friend of Kaneki and Touka. He knows which strategy the guys are using, so he wants to determine the final score, given the initial state of the game. Help him.
