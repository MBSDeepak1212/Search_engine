A manufacturing project consists of exactly KKK tasks. The board overviewing the project wants to hire KK teams of workers \xe2\x80\x94 one for each task. All teams begin working simultaneously.Obviously, there must be at least one person in each team. For a team of AA workers, it takes exactly AA days to complete the task they are hired for. Each team acts independently, unaware of the status of other teams (whether they have completed their tasks or not), and submits their result for approval on the AA-th day.However, the board approves the project only if all KK teams complete their tasks on the same day \xe2\x80\x94 it rejects everything submitted on any other day. The day after a team finds out that its result was rejected, it resumes work on the same task afresh. Therefore, as long as a team of AA workers keeps getting rejected, it submits a new result of their task for approval on the AA-th, 2A2A-th, 3A3A-th day etc.The board wants to hire workers in such a way that it takes exactly XX days to complete the project. Find the smallest number of workers it needs to hire.
