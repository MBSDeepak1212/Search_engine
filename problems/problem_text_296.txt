 Use of faster I/O methods is recommended.Chef has a sequence of N positive integers { a1, a2, a3, ... aN }. The Sous Chef wants to choose another sequence of N non-negative integers { b1, b2, b3, ... bN } such thatThe bitwise xor sum of these 2 sequences is equali.e, a1 ^ a2 ^ a3 ^ ... aN = b1 ^ b2 ^ b3 ^ ... bNfor each i, bi \xe2\x89\xa4 aiThe Sous Chef asks for your help. Your allegiance to the Chef withstanding, you tell him that you will not generate such a sequence for him. Instead, you will tell him the number of such sequences possible.
