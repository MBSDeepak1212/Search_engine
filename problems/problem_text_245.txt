In between cooking lunch and dinner, Chef has decided to take some time off to read about the Activity Selection Problem. In that problem, there are MMM time intervals [l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lM,rM][l1,r1],[l2,r2],\xe2\x80\xa6,[lM,rM][l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \\ldots, [l_M, r_M]. A solution to the problem is a maximum subset of these intervals such that no two intervals from this subset have a common point (sharing an endpoint is also forbidden), i.e. a set containing the maximum possible number of such intervals.Since solving this problem proved to be too easy, Chef is now wondering: in how many ways could he pick a set of MMM distinct intervals such that all of their endpoints belong to the set {1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N}{1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N}\\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\} and the number of intervals in the solution to the Activity Selection Problem for this set is exactly KKK? Since the result may be very large, compute it modulo MODMODMOD.
