 Most of all, he loves equations. He can solve any equation in the whole world. Recently he found one interesting and easy equationx1d+x2d+x3d \xe2\x89\xa1 m (mod N)Where x1, x2 and x3 are non negative integer numbers.But, as always, this was easy enough for him and he solved it in just a few seconds. Now he wants you to do the same. Of course he understands that nobody is as good as he is, so he wants only the number of solutions of such equation which satisfies 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x1, x2, x3 \xe2\x89\xa4 upper for given upper, d,m and N. As the answer might be very large, he asks you to find the answer modulo 1000000007.
