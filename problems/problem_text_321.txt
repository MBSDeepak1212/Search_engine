 Each row, contains exactly M chairs. Each chair is expected to be filled by exactly one student; you may assume no chair is ever empty.Curiously, N*M is guaranteed to be an even number. This means there are always an even number of students in a class. The students come to the Academy of Bit Wizardry from (N*M / 2) coutries. In fact, exactly 2 students come from each country.You enter the classroom and find all the students sitting. This displeases you and you request them to stand up. They tell you that they are going to play a game with you. You will play the game move by move. In each move you first make 1 student stand up and declare his country name. Then, you make another student stand up and declare his country name. If both the students belong to the same country, they both remain standing. Otherwise, they will now both sit down. Of course, you may ask the same student to stand up again in a later move.You grin as you know you have an amazing memory. Although you don't know initially which student belongs to what country, you are sure that once a student declares it, you will remember it indefinitely. You will never have to make a student stand up more than twice. Soon, you will have the entire class standing.There is no way for you to know what country a student belongs to initially. You could choose a fixed strategy that does not optimize itself based on the responses the students are giving and easily have the class standing in exactly N*M moves. But you are smarter; hence, you will dynamically optimize your strategy based on their responses.Assuming that the students choose their chairs uniformally randomly over all possible seatings, what is the expected number of moves that such a dynamically optimized optimal strategy would take to make every student stand up?
