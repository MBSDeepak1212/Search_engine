 A subarray of an array is an array composed from a contiguous block of the original array's elements. There is another thing given by the teacher that. Once the above maximum sum subarrays are selected, Akshay is allowed to remove atmost one element from them, to maximise the result further. There should be atleast one element in the subarray at the end. Since Akshay is sleepy, can you solve the problem for him? Note: Remember that you can remove atmost one element from a maximum sum subarray and not the other part of array. Note: In case of two subarrays having equal value, take that sub-array which will give maximum value after removal of atmost one element.
