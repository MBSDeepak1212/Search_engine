 As usual, the rules of this game are extremely strange and uncommon.First, they are given a stack of NNN discs. Each disc has a distinct, non-negative integer written on it. The players exchange turns to make a move. Before the start of the game, they both agree upon a set of positive integers  SSS of size KKK. It is guaranteed that S contains the integer 111. In a move, a player can select any value xxx from SSS and pop exactly xxx elements from the top of the stack. The game ends when there are no discs remaining. Chef goes first.Scoring: For every disc a player pops, his score increases by 2p2p2^p where ppp is the integer written on the disc. For example, if a player pops the discs, with integers p1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pmp1,p2,p3,\xe2\x80\xa6,pmp_1, p_2, p_3, \\dots, p_m written on it, during the entire course of the game, then his total score will be 2p1+2p2+2p3+\xe2\x8b\xaf+2pm2p1+2p2+2p3+\xe2\x8b\xaf+2pm2^{p_1} + 2^{p_2} + 2^{p_3} + \\dots + 2^{p_m}.The player with higher score wins the game. Determine the winner if both the players play optimally, or if the game ends in a draw.
