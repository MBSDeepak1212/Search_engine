There is a building with NNN floors (numbered 11 through NN from bottom to top); on each floor, there are MM windows (numbered 11 through MM from left to right). Let's denote the jj-th window on the ii-th floor by (i,j)(i, j).All windows in the building need to be cleaned one by one in a specific order. You are given this order as a matrix AA with NN rows and MM columns; for each valid ii and jj, the window (i,j)(i, j) must be cleaned on the AN\xe2\x88\x92i+1,jA_{N-i+1,j}-th turn. Whenever we clean a window (i,j)(i, j), it becomes clean, but the dirty water used for cleaning it flows down to windows (i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i-1, j-1), (i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i-1, j) and (i\xe2\x88\x921,j+1)(i-1, j+1) (more precisely, to all of these windows which exist), so these windows become dirty again. Then, the water flows further down, so the same applies for other windows below: whenever a window (i,j)(i, j) becomes dirty, windows (i\xe2\x88\x921,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i-1, j-1), (i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i-1, j) and (i\xe2\x88\x921,j+1)(i-1, j+1) become dirty as well. For example, cleaning a window (5,3)(5, 3) will make the window (3,2)(3, 2) dirty. The next window is cleaned only after water flows down completely. Note that each window is cleaned only once and there may be dirty windows at the end.For each window, determine whether it will be clean after the cleaning process ends.
