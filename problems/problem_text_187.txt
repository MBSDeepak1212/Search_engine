There are N stairs, numbered 111 to NNN, out of which KKK stairs are wet and the class is at the end of the NNN - th stair. Chozi can skip 111 or 222 stairs if needed to avoid a wet stair, i.e. if Chozi is on the iii-th stair, he can go to i+1i+1i+1-th ,i+2i+2i+2-th ,i+3i+3i+3 - th stair. Chozi is not a very punctual student and won't mind skipping a lecture if he cannot avoid all the wet stairs. Help him find the total number of ways in which he can reach the NNN-th  stair by avoiding all the wet stairs if he only moves forward.Find this number of possible ways modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.
