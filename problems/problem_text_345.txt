 Each bullet has some power level PiPiP_i. A ghost can sometimes destroy the magical bullets if it possesses any of the skill S in the range 2 to K (both inclusive) such that S is a factor of PiPiP_i.Given the set of guns (the power of the guns), Chef is having and chef wants to pick only those guns such that the ghost cannot destroy the bullet. Also whenever Chef picks up another gun the power level of this gun should be strictly greater than the previously used gun. He also does not want to alter the order of guns.A ghost is eliminated only when the sum of powers of bullets it is shot with is greater than or equal to a value X.Given the powers of guns, the value of K, and the value of X for a ghost find out whether this ghost can be killed or not.inputfirst line contains ttt number of test casesfirst line of each test-case contains three space separated integers N,K,XN,K,XN,K,Xsecond line of each test-case contains NNN space separated integers, PiPiP_ioutputfor each test-case, print "YES" if ghost can be killed ,else "NO"constraints1\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021\xe2\x89\xa4T\xe2\x89\xa41021 \\leq T \\leq 10^21\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4N,X\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq N,X \\leq 10^52\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41042\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa41042 \\leq K \\leq 10^41\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41051\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41051 \\leq P_i \\leq 10^5example input15 4 31 9 5 7 2example outputYESexplanationchef can pick bullets 1,5,7 and hence the ghost is killedAuthor:4\xe2\x98\x85skrstv123Editorial:https://discuss.codechef.com/problems/MAGIC123Tags:                                dynamic-programming, easy, enno2020, sieve, skrstv123                                                                                  Difficulty Rating:                    N/ADate Added:12-11-2020Time Limit:1 secsSource Limit:50000 BytesLanguages:CPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEMSubmit'
