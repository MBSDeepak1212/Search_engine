 The day of that practice round has now arrived and they are very eager to get started. They have picked up an ordered set of N problems to solve. Now, since they are newbies in the fieldof programming, they have chosen problems which are not so tough.Hence, every problem that they have taken is solvable by all the three members.To make it feel like the regional contest, they have decided to use only a single computer system.Since they are newbies, instead of optimizing on time and resources they have come up with the following plan to decide on how they would attempt to solve the problems. They have divided their total time in N time slots. In the ith time slot, they will code up the ith problem. Since they are easy problems, it is known that each problem would be solved within the given time slot. In each time slot, the computer will be allotted to either V, J or K. They will not share the computer with anyone else in the time slot allocated to them.Now all that is left is to decide who will solve which problem on the computer. To make things easier, all of them have listed their requirements on how the distribution of the problems should be.K being a lover of the number k has decided that the total number of problems coded by him will be a multiple of k.J being a busy guy decided to never code problems in consecutive slots. In the gaps between his slots, he has some other work that he wants to finish.V being a relatively new coder, wants to code at least one problem from the whole set.Your task is to find out the number of ways in which they can distribute the problems amongst themselves.
