He has N different colors of balls, all colors are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive. There are C1 balls of the first color, C2 balls of the second color, ..., CN balls of the Nth color. All balls of the same color are identical.Now he wants to arrange all the balls in a row in such a way that no two consecutive balls have the same color. But he wonders in how many ways can he arrange all the balls. Help him to find the number of ways of arranging all the balls. The number can be very large, so you must output this number modulo 1000000007 (109+7).
