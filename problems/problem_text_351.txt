 In that word, same vowel can be repeated contiguously,(boldness for emphasis). Check example just below:Example: aba is same as aaba, abaa, abaaaaa, abaaaaaaaaa,aaaaba,aaabaaa. But consonants must be placed as it is between the vowels.You will be given an array of length 5 (that is 5 space separated integers) where 0 index represents count of a, 1 count of e, 2 count of i, 3 count of o and 4 count u. You will also be given a word "G" consisting of lowercase alphabets without any repeated contiguous vowels.There will be enough vowels to make the word.All the given vowels in the array must be used up, if and only if that vowel is there in the given word "G".(quotes are used for clarity).Example: a is 5, e is 2, i is 3, o is 2, u is 4and G is "abu" , then the only way to write it is "aaaaabuuuu" (quotes for clarity), using all the 5 a\'s and 4 u\'s and since only \'a\' and \'u\' is there in the given word so we use those only.\xc2\xa0
