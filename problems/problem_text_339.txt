 He hates even numbers and would like to make the array full of only odd numbers. To do so, he is allowed to do the following operation.Pick a positive integer XXX such that X=2YX=2YX = 2^Y for some non-negative integer YYY. Then, for all elements AiAiA_i in AAA, if AiAiA_i is divisible by XXX, then we divide AiAiA_i by XXX (in other words, we assign Ai\xe2\x86\x90AiXAi\xe2\x86\x90AiXA_i \\leftarrow \\frac{A_i}{X}).Let's define f(B)f(B)f(B) as the minimum operations required to make an array BBB have only odd numbers using the operation described above. Find the sum of f(a)f(a)f(a) over all subarrays aaa of AAA.Note: A subarray of AAA is acquired by removing some (possibly none) elements from the beginning and some (possible none) elements from the end of AAA.
