We say that a binary string (a string containing only characters \'0\' and \'1\') is pure if it does not contain either of the strings "0101" or "1010" as a subsequence.Recall that string T is a subsequence of string S if we can delete some of the letters of S (possibly none) such that the resulting string will become T.You are given a binary string SSS with length NNN. We want to make this string pure by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from it. What is the minimum number of characters we have to delete?
