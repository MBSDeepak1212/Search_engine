You are given a tree with NNN nodes (numbered 11 through NN), rooted at node 11. For each valid ii, node ii has a value aia_i written on it.An undirected simple path between any two nodes uu and vv is said to be vertical if u=vu=v or uu is an ancestor of vv or vv is an ancestor of uu. Let's define a vertical partition of the tree as a set of vertical paths such that each node belongs to exactly one of these paths.You are also given a sequence of NN integers b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bNb_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_N. A vertical partition is good if, for each of its paths, we can permute the values written on the nodes in this path, and this can be done in such a way that we reach a state where for each valid ii, the value written on node ii is bib_i.The difficulty of your task is described by a parameter SS. If S=1S=1, your task is only to determine whether at least one good vertical partition exists. If S=2S=2, you are required to find the number of good vertical partitions modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+710^9+7).
