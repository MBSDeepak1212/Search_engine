Chef Dobby loves playing games, especially games related to numbers. So, today Bhuvan gave him a new game. The description of the game goes as follows : Consider an array A of N non-negative integers. You can do the following move any number of times, pick two numbers from the array (x, y), such that x \xe2\x89\xa5 y and convert them into (x - y, 2 * y). The aim of the game is to make the array contains exactly (N - 1) zeros. If Dobby achieves this, after any number of steps, he wins the game.Bhuvan wants to know the odds to choose an initial array satisfying for every index i, the condition 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 A[i] \xe2\x89\xa4 B[i] where B is given in input and Dobby wins the game with such an array. So please help him counting the number of such arrays, since the answer can be very large, output the answer modulo 109 + 7.
