 The missions are numbered from 111 to NNN. All agents have some intelligence level denoted by their IQ (a positive integer ) . Major Francis asked Perry the platypus for the list of agents to be sent on missions. For each mission: iii, there is  a default agent available (AiAiAi) , and an Special agent (BiBiBi) which may want some money(CiCiCi)  to go on mission. Perry is busy with Candice, now you have to prepare the list of agents with the minimum amount to pay. Remember that Perry loves sorted things.  More formally you have to make a non\xe2\x88\x92decreasingnon\xe2\x88\x92decreasingnon-decreasing list of the agent's IQ by either selecting a default agent or paid agent , with minimumminimumminimum possiblepossiblepossible payment, Or determine that list cannot be made.
