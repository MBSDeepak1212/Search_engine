Chef has a tree with NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN) and a non-negative integer xxx. The nodes of the tree have non-negative integer weights; let's denote the weight of node iii by aiaia_i.Next, let's define the XOR value of a tree as the bitwise XOR of weights of all its nodes.Chef wants to remove zero or more edges from his tree in such a way that each individual tree in the forest formed by removing these edges has XOR value xxx. Help him compute the number of ways to remove a set of edges such that this condition is satisfied. Since the answer may be large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.
