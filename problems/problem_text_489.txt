He had a breakup recently with Chefina and was trying to forget her phone number but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to.His friend Dr.Krishna,a neuroscience professor suggested chef to try a simple trick.The trick was to take parts of the number which have the same digits consecutively and delete them in one go.Formally,a K digit number takes K operations to be deleted previously.But now with this trick,you can delete some contiguous part of a number in one operation,if all the digits are the same.We define an operation as deleting some contiguous part of a number which has the same consecutive digits.Chef has had many breakups till now,so actually speaking he needs to forget many numbers as such.He can concatenate his first girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s number with his second girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s number and can delete it as whole.But he should make sure that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t concatenate his first girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s number with his third girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s number which turns out to be an injustice to his second girlfriend.In simple words,he can concatenate numbers in the order of his breakups and then delete them as a whole number or carry on with deleting the numbers individually.Chef wants to know the minimum number of operations it will take for him to delete all the numbers of his ex girlfriends.Help him to do so.Given N positive integers, find the minimum number of operations required to delete all of them.
