Alice thought of a function FFF, which takes an arbitrary array of integers A=(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AM)A=(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AM)A = (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_M) as the only argument and is defined in the following way:Consider all pairs of subarrays (Ai,Ai+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aj)(Ai,Ai+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Aj)(A_i, A_{i+1}, \\ldots, A_j) and (Ak,Ak+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Al)(Ak,Ak+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Al)(A_k, A_{k+1}, \\ldots, A_l) such that:1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j<k\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j<k\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le i \\le j \\lt k \\le l \\le Mboth subarrays are non-decreasingAj\xe2\x89\xa4AkAj\xe2\x89\xa4AkA_j \\le A_kIf there is no such pair of subarrays, F(A)=0F(A)=0F(A) = 0.Otherwise, F(A)F(A)F(A) is the maximum of the expression (j\xe2\x88\x92i+1)+(l\xe2\x88\x92k+1)(j\xe2\x88\x92i+1)+(l\xe2\x88\x92k+1)(j-i+1) + (l-k+1) over all such pairs of subarrays.In other words, you need to choose two non-overlapping non-empty subarrays of AAA and concatenate them in the same order; the resulting array should be non-decreasing and F(A)F(A)F(A) is its maximum possible length.Bob challenged Alice to solve the following problem and she needs your help.You are given a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN), rooted at the vertex 111. There is an integer written in each vertex; for each valid iii, let's denote the integer written in vertex iii by ViViV_i. You should choose one vertex \xe2\x80\x95 let's denote it by vvv. Then, consider an array AAA containing values which are written in vertices on the path from the root to vvv (inclusive), in this order, and calculate F(A)F(A)F(A). Find the maximum possible value of F(A)F(A)F(A) which you can obtain this way.
