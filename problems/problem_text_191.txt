Chef has a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. The sequence is circular, i.e. for each valid iii, elements AiAiA_i and Ai+1Ai+1A_{i+1} are considered adjacent, and elements A1A1A_1 and ANANA_N are also considered adjacent. Initially, each element of this sequence is either 111 or 000.You may perform some operations on this sequence. In one operation, you should choose an index iii such that Ai=1Ai=1A_i = 1 and move that 111 to one of its adjacent elements, i.e. change AiAiA_i to 000, choose one of the elements adjacent to AiAiA_i and increment it by 111.According to Chef, a sequence is good if all its elements are different from 111. You have to tell Chef the minimum number of operations needed to turn the sequence AAA into a good sequence or determine that it is impossible.
