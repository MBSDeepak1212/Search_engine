The task consists of two steps. First,Shaun should colour all NNN pairs of parenthesis each with different color but opening and closing bracket of a particular pair should be of same colour. Then,Shaun should report to his teacher the number of ways he can arrange all 2\xe2\x88\x97N2\xe2\x88\x97N2*N brackets such that sequence form is valid. Teacher defined valid sequence by these rules:Any left parenthesis '(' must have a corresponding right parenthesis ')'.Any right parenthesis ')' must have a corresponding left parenthesis '('.Left parenthesis '(' must go before the corresponding right parenthesis ')'. Note: Shaun could match opening and closing brackets of different colours. Since number of ways can be large, Shaun would report the answer as modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+710^9 + 7).
