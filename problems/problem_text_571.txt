 He has come across a mysterious dungeon filled with various threats and only one way to go through: using the platforms. The dungeon contains a number of platforms numbered from 000 to NNN. Out of these, some platforms are fake and will collapse into the underlying lava, if stepped on without making the platform safe. Chain has to go through every one of these platforms in order as there is no other way.To make these platforms safe, Chain has 444 different types of spells (and an unlimited amount of each spell). The details of the spells are as follows:Spell 1: Cost: cost[0]cost[0]cost[0] Effect: Makes platform numbered xxx safeSpell 2: Cost: cost[1]cost[1]cost[1] Effect: Makes the platforms numbered from xxx to x+6x+6x+6 safeSpell 3: Cost: cost[2]cost[2]cost[2] Effect: Makes the platforms numbered from xxx to x+13x+13x+13 safeSpell 4: Cost: cost[3]cost[3]cost[3] Effect: Makes the platforms numbered from xxx to x+29x+29x+29 safe(Here the ranges are inclusive and platform xxx is the current platform. If a platform is already safe, it remains safe)Chain can successfully cross the dungeon only when the last of these unsafe platforms is made safe to cross. Chain starts on platform 000 which is safe beforehand. He now wants to minimize the costs of spells that will help him cross the dungeon. He wants your help in minimizing the cost because the threats of the dungeons have got to him!
