You are given a string SS. Find the number of ways to choose an unordered pair of non-overlapping non-empty substrings of this string (let\'s denote them by s1s_1 and s2s_2 in such a way that s2s_2 starts after s1s_1 ends) such that their concatenation s1+s2s_1 + s_2 is a palindrome.Two pairs (s1,s2)(s_1, s_2) and (s\xe2\x80\xb21,s\xe2\x80\xb22)(s_1\', s_2\') are different if s1s_1 is chosen at a different position from s\xe2\x80\xb21s_1\' or s2s_2 is chosen at a different position from s\xe2\x80\xb22s_2\'.
