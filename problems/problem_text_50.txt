Consider NNN binary variables x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xNx_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N. For each valid ii, the ii-th of these variables can be xi=0x_i = 0 or xi=1x_i = 1; therefore, there are 2N2^N possible assignments of values to the variables. For each valid ii, setting xi=1x_i = 1 gives you score gig_i.In addition, there are MM special intervals (numbered 11 through MM). For each valid ii, the ii-th interval is [ui,vi][u_i, v_i] and if xui=xui+1=\xe2\x80\xa6=xvi=1x_{u_i} = x_{u_i+1} = \\ldots = x_{v_i} = 1, then your score increases by did_i.Note that both gig_i and did_i can be negative (setting more variables to 11 can decrease your score), and your score can also be negative. Formally, the score of an assignment of values to the binary variables isN\xe2\x88\x91i=1gi\xe2\x8b\x85xi+M\xe2\x88\x91i=1di\xe2\x8b\x85vi\xe2\x88\x8fj=uixj.\\sum_{i=1}^N g_i \\cdot x_i + \\sum_{i=1}^M d_i \\cdot \\prod_{j=u_i}^{v_i} x_j \\,.Find the KK highest scores among all assignments on these variables. Formally, if we computed the scores of all 2N2^N assignments and sorted them in non-increasing order, you should find the first KK of these values.
