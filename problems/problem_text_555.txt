And he has bought a huge mansion with half of the lottery amount.   Now he has hired NNN maids (numbered from 111 to NNN) to take care of the mansion! Each maid has her report card from National Housekeeper Examination!The report card of each maid has 3 different fields - Vacuuming skills , Laundry skills and Dish-washing skills.Each maid has got a score for each of the different skills; Ram will assign each maid only one type of task i.e Vacuuming or Laundry or Dish-washing.No maid shall do more than one type of task.Also, Ram got to know that for each i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N\xe2\x88\x921]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N\xe2\x88\x921]i \\in [1,N-1],  ithithi^{th} maid is friend of (i+1)th(i+1)th(i+1)^{th} maid.Ram also knows that if he assign both ithithi^{th} and (i+1)th(i+1)th(i+1)^{th} maid the same type of task then they will gossip all day and not work properly.So Ram won't assign them same type of task i.e tasks given to ithithi^{th} and (i+1)th(i+1)th(i+1)^{th} maid shall not be same.Let Assigned score of the ithithi^{th} maid be equal to the score on her report card for the type of task she's assigned.Now Ram wonders what is the maximum total assigned score he can get.
