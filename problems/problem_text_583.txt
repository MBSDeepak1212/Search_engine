 But to Chef\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment the highway is not so smooth, it has some potholes and moreover the highway has a fixed length, after that it is brokenbrokenbroken. The highway is straight and is given in the form of a binary string. Binary string is a string consisting of only 1s and 0s. 1s representing the highway is smoothsmoothsmooth at that point and 0s representing the highway has potholespotholespotholes in that position.Chef\xe2\x80\x99s car has initial fuel in the car as FFF, which represents the distance the car can travel with that much fuel. Chef\xe2\x80\x99s car has a reserve fuel in it too but at any point it can be used for increasing the fuel from FFF to F+1F+1F+1. Assume he has unlimited reserve fuel but can only use 111 unit of it to increase FFF to F+1F+1F+1 at a stopping point and as soon as FFF becomes 000 he will not be able to use his reserve fuel anymore.Chef can use F\xe2\x88\x921F\xe2\x88\x921F-1 fuel or FFF fuel and due to the reserve he can also use F+1F+1F+1 fuel. So he has 333 points to stop at F\xe2\x88\x921+P,F+P,F+1+PF\xe2\x88\x921+P,F+P,F+1+PF-1+P, F+P, F+1+P where P is the current position and at those points the fuel for the next part of the journey will be F\xe2\x88\x921,F,F+1F\xe2\x88\x921,F,F+1F-1, F, F+1 respectively. Chef stops when he has 000 Fuel left with him and in this case he can\xe2\x80\x99t use his reserve fuel. But he can\xe2\x80\x99t stop at a position with a pothole.So, he asks you to tell him that, will he be able to stop on a flat surface and not a pothole until his fuel FFF becomes 000, within the bounds of the highway. If there is still fuel left till the end of the highway then he will not stop within the bounds of the highway and the answer would be NONONO otherwise the answer is YESYESYES if he stops within the highway and always stops at flat surfaces.
