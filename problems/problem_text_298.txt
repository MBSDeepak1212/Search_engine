Chef's apartment consists of MMM floors (numbered 111 through MMM), and there's an elevator that is used to move between different floors. The elevator is connected with a computer which registers its movement in a sequence BBB. Whenever the elevator moves to a different floor, the computer appends the new floor number to sequence BBB. Currently, the sequence BBB has NNN elements.Unfortunately, the computer is infected with a virus which replaced some elements of BBB by \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921-1s. Chef now wants to know what could be the minimum number of times the elevator has changed its direction. That is, how many times the elevator was going up then started going down and vice versa. Help chef by answering his question or determine that the sequence BBB is invalid.
