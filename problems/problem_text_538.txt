 Both of them are going to have dinner. On seeing this, Rinku gets jealous of Ankit and decides to trick him. He goes to Ankit and asks him to solve a problem. There are NNN varieties of soup in the party and NNN identical bowls are placed on Simmi's plate. Rinku has a favorite number maxmaxmax and Simmi's favorite number is 222. Rinku asks Ankit to tell him the maximum value of NNN such that the total number of ways of selecting the soups are less than Rinku's favorite number. The variety of different soups on Simmi's plate is at least equal to her favorite number. Note that bowls can also be empty.
