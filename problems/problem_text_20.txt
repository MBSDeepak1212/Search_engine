Chef is given a sequence of prime numbers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. This sequence has exactly 2N2^N subsequences. A subsequence of AA is good if it does not contain any two identical numbers; in particular, the empty sequence is good.Chef has to find the number of good subsequences which contain at most KK numbers. Since he does not know much about subsequences, help him find the answer. This number could be very large, so compute it modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007.
