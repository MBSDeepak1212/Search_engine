\xc2\xa0Nobody knows but Chef can play with words! He has a word. He claps and each letter of the word transform to another letter(independently)! All letters are only in range a-z. For each pair of symbols from 'a' to 'z' there is a probability that first symbol will transform into second one after clapping. Note that the symbol can also transform into the same symbol. Also Chef has a list of words. He asks you what is the probability that after exactly K claps Chef's word will equal one of the words from list? \xc2\xa0
