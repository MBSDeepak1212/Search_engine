 But Tom likes to collect cut-outs of words from the newspaper. The most weird fact is that he decides a word WWW for a newspaper and cuts out its occurrences from that newspaper. But he is lazy, he skims through the newspaper and whenever he finds an occurrence of WWW in the newspaper, he cuts it out. In this process he might skip some occurrences. Also, some occurrences might overlap, for example in ababaababaababa, the occurrences of abaabaaba is overlapping. So, if Tom cuts out one of the occurrences, the other no longer exists.Given a newspaper as a string NNN (containing only lowercase English letters) [very weird newspaper indeed!] and a word WWW (also containing only lowercase English letters), find the total number of ways in which Tom can cut out at least one occurrence of WWW in NNN. (See sample input for better understanding).
