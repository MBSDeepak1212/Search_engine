There is a communication channel with N+1N+1N+1 stations (numbered 000 through NNN). Station 000 wants to send a message to station NNN. You may install memory disks at up to KKK of the stations 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x9211,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N\xe2\x88\x9211, 2, \\ldots, N-1. Let's denote the increasing sequence of stations at which memory disks are installed by (v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk)(v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk)(v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k), where k\xe2\x89\xa4Kk\xe2\x89\xa4Kk \\le K is the number of such stations, and let v0=0v0=0v_0 = 0 and vk+1=Nvk+1=Nv_{k+1} = N. In stations other than v0,v1,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk+1v0,v1,\xe2\x80\xa6,vk+1v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_{k+1}, it is only possible to send the message forward without storing it for later.For each iii (0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N0\xe2\x89\xa4i<N0 \\le i \\lt N), if the message is currently at the station iii, this station can send the message to the station i+1i+1i + 1. This transfer takes one second regardless of its success or failure. With probability pipip_i, the transfer succeeds and the message reaches the station i+1i+1i + 1. Otherwise, the transfer fails and the message instantly goes back to the station vjvjv_j, where jjj is the unique index such that vj\xe2\x89\xa4i<vj+1vj\xe2\x89\xa4i<vj+1v_j \\le i \\lt v_{j+1} (if i=vji=vji = v_j, the message simply stays in the station vjvjv_j), and this station has to send it forward again.Your task is to choose stations where memory disks should be installed, in such a way that the expected value of time needed for the message to reach station NNN is the smallest possible. Find this smallest expected time.You are not given the probabilities directly. Instead, you are given a non-increasing integer sequence F0,F1,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF0,F1,\xe2\x80\xa6,FNF_0, F_1, \\ldots, F_N. For each valid iii, pi=Fi+1/Fipi=Fi+1/Fip_i = F_{i+1} / F_i.
