 The i-th item of the array will have a weight (WiWiW_i) and a profit (PiPiP_i) value associated with it.You are allowed to ask the chef the value of dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j], for a given i,ji,ji, j where dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j] denotes the maximum amount of profit you can earn if you pick the best subset of items from the first iii items of the array such that the sum of the weights of the picked items doesn't exceed jjj.Your aim is to determine the weight and profit of each item, i.e recover the WWW and PPP array.You are allowed to query at most 150015001500 times.InteractionThe first line of the input contains a single integer NNN, denoting the number of items in the array.You need to print to the standard output, for the operations you wish to perform. There are two types of operations:In the first type, you are asking the judge the value of dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j]. You need to print a single line with 111 iii jjj, where the judge will return a single value by printing the integer in the standard input. It will be the value of dp[i][j]dp[i][j]dp[i][j].In the second type, you are telling the judge the answer. For each test case, you should perform this operation exactly once at the end. This operation is not taken into account when counting the number of queries done.You need to print 333 lines:The first line starts with 222, denoting the type of query.The second line consists of NNN integers denoting the WWW weights array in the format W1W1W_1 W2W2W_2 W3W3W_3 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\\dots WNWNW_N.The third line consists of NNN integers denoting the PPP profits array in the format P1P1P_1 P2P2P_2 P3P3P_3 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\\dots PNPNP_N.NoteDon't forget to flush the standard output after printing each line. It can be done using fflush(stdout) in C/C++, System.out.flush() in Java and sys.stdout.flush() in Python.If you exceed 150015001500 queries OR If in the first type of query, iii and jjj don't satisfy the inequalities 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq j \\leq 10^4 OR The WWW and PPP in the second type of query don't satisfy the inequality 1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq W_{i} \\leq 100 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq P_{i} \\leq 10^6, for all i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N]i \\in [1, N] then your program will get the verdict Wrong Answer.Also note that there is a hidden WWW and PPP array and the solution is going to be matched exactly against it, i.e there is a unique solution for each test case.Constraints2\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41022\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x89\xa41022 \\leq N \\leq 10^2For each query of first type: 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq N and 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa41041\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa41041 \\leq j \\leq 10^4For the query of second type: 1\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41001\xe2\x89\xa4Wi\xe2\x89\xa41001 \\leq W_{i} \\leq 100 and 1\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41061\xe2\x89\xa4Pi\xe2\x89\xa41061 \\leq P_{i} \\leq 10^6, for all i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N]i\xe2\x88\x88[1,N]i \\in [1, N] ExampleJudge                                          You2                                                    1 1 20                                                    1 1 32                                                    1 2 93                                                    1 2 105                                                    2                                                    3 7                                                    2 3ExplanationWe get that W=[3,7]W=[3,7]W = [3, 7] and P=[2,3]P=[2,3]P = [2, 3].Author:6\xe2\x98\x85sidhant007Editorial:https://discuss.codechef.com/problems/INVSACKTags:                                Interactive Problems, Bottom-up, Binary Search                                                           Special, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, DP Approach, Searching                                                                                  Difficulty Rating:                    N/ADate Added:6-12-2019Time Limit:2 secsSource Limit:50000 BytesLanguages:PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEMSubmit"
