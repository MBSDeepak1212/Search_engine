The Mongoose Land consists of N cities and they are connected by N - 1 bidirectional roads in such a manner that you can travel from one city to another city in exactly one path. In other words, the map looks like a tree. The cities are numbered from 1 to N.King Cobra has decided that he wants to eliminate the mongooses, and is hence preparing to wage a war. The snakes have recently procured airplanes, and thus they can parachute their soldiers onto some of the Mongoose Land cities. Suppose on Day 0, these soldiers are parachuted. You know that to capture City i, you need to parachute in Pi soldiers. By end  of Day 0, they would have captured their respective cities.Each city depends on its neighbors for some of its supplies, and so, if a certain number of its neighbors are captured, then this city will fall as well. In particular, for every City i, you know that if City i was uncaptured on Day d, and at least Ci of its neighbors are captured on Day d, then this city will be captured on Day d+1, where d \xe2\x89\xa5 0. A city which has been captured will forever remain captured.King Cobra doesn't mind waiting for however long it takes to capture the entire Mongoose kingdom, but he wants to do it with the least number of soldiers. Help him find the least number of soldiers he should send so that the entire Mongoose kingdom can be captured eventually.Formally, you need to find a subset of cities, S, such that the sum of Pi over these cities is minimized, and the entire kingdom will be captured eventually, if soldiers are parachuted into exactly these cities. You need to output this minimum sum.
