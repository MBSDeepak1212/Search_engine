 The roads are bidirectional and there is some cost associated with each of these roads.Roads are given in the format [uuu, vvv, www] which denotes that there is a road between station uuu and station vvv with cost www.A path is a sequence of stations [S0S0S_0, S1S1S_1, S2S2S_2, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6 SKSKS_K] such that S0S0S_0 is the starting station and SKSKS_K is the destination station and there is a road between every SiSiS_i & Si+1Si+1S_{i+1}, where 0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x9210 \\leq i \\leq K-1.Your task is to find the number of easy paths from station 000 to station N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1. Easy path is a path that satisfies: elevation(SiSiS_i) > elevation(Si+1Si+1S_{i+1}) for 0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x88\x9210 \\leq i \\leq K-1. Elevation of a station is defined as the minimum cost of this station from station no. N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1.Since that number may be too large, print it modulo 10910910^{9} + 777.
