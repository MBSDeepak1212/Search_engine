 Each square in the grid contains an integer AAA. You are given a supply of rectangular 2\xc3\x9712 \\times 1 tiles, each of which exactly covers two adjacent squares of the grid. You have to place tiles to cover all the squares in the grid such that each tile covers two squares and no pair of tiles overlap.The score for a tile is the di\xef\xac\x80erence between the bigger and the smaller number that is covered by the tile. The aim of the game is to maximize the sum of the scores of all the tiles.Here is an example of a grid, along with two different tilings and their scores.The score for Tiling 11 is 12 = (9 \xe2\x88\x92 8) + (6 \xe2\x88\x92 2) + (7 \xe2\x88\x92 1) + (3 \xe2\x88\x92 2) while the score for Tiling 22 is 6 = (8 \xe2\x88\x92 6) + (9 \xe2\x88\x92 7) + (3 \xe2\x88\x92 2) + (2 \xe2\x88\x92 1). There are other tilings possible for this grid, but you can check that Tiling 11 has the maximum score among all tilings. Your task is to read the grid of numbers and compute the maximum score that can be achieved by any tiling of the grid.Your task is to read the grid of numbers and compute the maximum score that can be achieved by any tiling of the grid.
