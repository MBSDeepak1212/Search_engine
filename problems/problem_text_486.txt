 Hasan is one of the most famous inventors in the world. One day, he invented a wonderful machine in order to examine the possibility of generating new palindrome strings by merging other strings.Hasan\'s machine takes a sequence of strings (A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AK)(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AK)(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_K) as the input; KKK may be any positive integer. The length of each of these strings must be exactly NNN; for each valid jjj, let\'s denote the jjj-th character of the iii-th string by Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j}. The machine magically generates a string BBB by merging these strings and it determines if BBB is a palindrome. The string BBB is generated as follows:B1=A1,1,B2=A2,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,BK=AK,1B1=A1,1,B2=A2,1,\xe2\x80\xa6,BK=AK,1B_1 = A_{1, 1}, B_2 = A_{2, 1}, \\ldots, B_K = A_{K, 1}BK+1=A1,2,BK+2=A2,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,B2\xe2\x8b\x85K=AK,2BK+1=A1,2,BK+2=A2,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,B2\xe2\x8b\x85K=AK,2B_{K+1} = A_{1, 2}, B_{K+2} = A_{2, 2}, \\ldots, B_{2 \\cdot K} = A_{K, 2}\xe2\x80\xa6B(N\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85K+1=A1,N,B(N\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85K+2=A2,N,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\xe2\x8b\x85K=AK,NB(N\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85K+1=A1,N,B(N\xe2\x88\x921)\xe2\x8b\x85K+2=A2,N,\xe2\x80\xa6,BN\xe2\x8b\x85K=AK,NB_{(N-1) \\cdot K + 1} = A_{1, N}, B_{(N-1) \\cdot K + 2} = A_{2, N}, \\ldots, B_{N \\cdot K} = A_{K, N}Hasan wants to test his new machine, so he prepared NNN strings S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N. Each of these strings has length NNN. Now, he wants to choose a sequence of KKK pairwise distinct indices i1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,iKi1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,iKi_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_K, where 1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4K\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le K \\le M, and run the machine with strings (Si1,Si2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SiK)(Si1,Si2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SiK)(S_{i_1}, S_{i_2}, \\ldots, S_{i_K}). His goal is to make the machine report that the string it generated is a palindrome.Can you help Hasan with testing his machine and tell him the number of sequences of indices he can choose? Since the answer could be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.
