You are given a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N.You should choose an arbitrary (possibly empty) subsequence of AA and multiply each element of this subsequence by \xe2\x88\x921-1. The resulting sequence should satisfy the following condition: the sum of elements of any contiguous subsequence with length greater than 1 is strictly positive.You should minimise the sum of elements of the resulting sequence. Find one such sequence with the minimum possible sum.
