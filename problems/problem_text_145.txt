There are N hills arranged in a row, and each of them is assigned a unique index from 1 to N \xe2\x80\x94 the ith hill has an index Pi on it. The height of the ith hill is Hi.Chef starts at the first hill with a goal to reach the Nth hill by jumping over hills from left to right (he is not allowed to jump in the other direction), jumping from ith hill to jth costs (Hj - Hi)2 energy.When chief is on the ith hill, he has to prepare a special dish for the community of that hill as a thanks for letting him use their resources. This will cost him Ai energy (some dishes are chief's favorites and preparing it refreshes chef that why Ai may be negative). To make things more challenging for Chef the chief, he is allowed to jump from ith hill to jth if and only if i < j and Pi < Pj.Help Chef choose the sequence of jumps that consume the minimum energy possible. (Note that it's possible at any moment that energy consumed is negative.)
