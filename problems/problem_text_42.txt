Chef is a big fan of soccer! He loves soccer so much, that he even invented soccer for his pet dogs! Here are the rules of the game:There are N dogs numerated from 1 to N stay in a line, so dogs i and i + 1 are adjacent. There is a ball which dogs will pass around. Initially, dog s has the ball.A dog with ball can pass it to another dog. If the current pass-strength of dog is x, then it can pass the ball to either  dog i - x or dog i + x (provided such dog/s exist).To make it even more exciting, Chef created an array A of M positive integers denoting pass strengths. In i-th pass, current pass-strength of the dog making the pass will be given by Ai.Chef asks dogs to execute these M passes one by one. As stated before, dog s will make the first pass, then some other dog and so on till M passes.Dogs quickly found out that there can be lot of possible sequences of passes which will end up with a dog having the ball. Now each dog asks your help in finding number of different pass sequences which result in this dog ending up ball. Two pass sequences are considered different if after some number of passes they lead the ball to different dogs. As the answer could be quite large, output it modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007).
