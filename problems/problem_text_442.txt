Arya has a pet mouse named Jack. She put Jack in a grid with NNN rows (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM columns (numbered 111 through MMM). There are KKK cheese wedges scattered over the grid; for each wedge, we know how long it takes Jack to eat it.Let's denote the cell in row rrr and column ccc by (r,c)(r,c)(r, c). Initially, Jack is in the cell (1,1)(1,1)(1, 1). When Jack is in a cell (r,c)(r,c)(r, c), he can move to either of the cells (r,c\xe2\x88\x921)(r,c\xe2\x88\x921)(r, c-1) or (r,c+1)(r,c+1)(r, c+1) in 111 second. If he is in the first or last column of the grid (c=1c=1c=1 or c=Mc=Mc=M), he can also move to the cell (r+1,c)(r+1,c)(r+1, c) in 111 second. Jack can only eat a cheese wedge if he is in the same cell as the wedge.Your task is to help Jack find out, for each possible iii, the minimum number of seconds Jack needs to eat iii cheese wedges.
