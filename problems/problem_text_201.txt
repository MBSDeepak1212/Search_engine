 Chef has a test tomorrow and he being irresponsible failed to prepare for it on time (just as always). However, fortunately, he now realises the gravity of the situation and decides to prepare as much as possible in the time remaining and try to score maximum marks possible using his analytical skills. There are NNN chapters and only KKK minutes are left before the exam. Chapter iii will be worth MiMiM_i marks in the exam, and shall take TiTiT_i minutes to study. Chef can study the chapters in any order but needs to study them completely and at most once. He knows that he will forget the first chapter that he will prepare (due to lack of sleep) and won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to score any marks in it. Find the maximum marks that Chef can score in the exam. Note that he cannot re-study the chapter that he has forgotten.
