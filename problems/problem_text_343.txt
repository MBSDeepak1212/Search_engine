 There are lefties and righties in Chefland. The laws of Chefland physics dictate that the probability of every lefty player winning against any righty player is P. Today Chefland will organize its first grand slam tournament in which M lefty and N righty player will participate. It is guaranteed that M + N is a power of two.The draw is assumed to be a full balanced binary tree with one player assigned to each of the leaves, and thus every player would have to win the same number of games to get to the final. Initial draw is chosen uniformly at random from all permutations.Chef wants to see the next Rafael Nadal being produced in Chefland, and was therefore wondering about the probability of the tournament being won by a lefty player?  Please help Chef in finding it.
