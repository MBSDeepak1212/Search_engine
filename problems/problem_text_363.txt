 You want to divide all of these numbers into two groups with equal sum. However, it's not always possible.To make it possible, in one operation you are allowed to choose any 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N and receive an extra number 2i2i2^i (in other words, you can increase any AiAiA_i by 111). Let's define f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)f(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N) as the smallest number of operations that you need to make to be able to split the numbers into two groups with equal sums.You are given NNN integers B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BNB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_N. Find the sum of f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)f(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)f(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N) over all tuples (A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)(A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN)(A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N) with 0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Bi0\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4Bi0 \\le A_i \\le B_i (there are (B1+1)(B2+1)\xe2\x80\xa6(BN+1)(B1+1)(B2+1)\xe2\x80\xa6(BN+1)(B_1+1)(B_2+1)\\ldots (B_N+1) of them). As this number may be very large, output it modulo 998244353998244353998244353.
