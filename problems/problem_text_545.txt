  For each array given, You have to find the maximum sum of a subsequence with the constraint that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent to each other in the array and store it in the new array which will be of the size n. Now, you have a  single new array of size n. From that find the minimum sum of a subsequence by using the maximum number of elements in an array with the constraint that no two numbers in the sequence should be adjacent to each other in the array and print it.
