Chef likes to solve difficult tasks. This time, he tried to solve the Big Famous Unsolvable A+B=CA+B=CA+B=C. One of his friends played a prank on Chef and randomly shuffled the bits in AA and BB (independently in each number). However, the funny thing is that the sum of the resulting numbers remained CC even after shuffling.Chef is now wondering: in how many ways is it possible to shuffle the bits of AA and the bits of BB such that their sum after shuffling is equal to CC? Let's denote the integers obtained by shuffling the bits of AA and BB by AsA_s and BsB_s respectively; two ways (As1,Bs1)(A_{s1}, B_{s1}) and (As2,Bs2)(A_{s2}, B_{s2}) are considered distinct if As1\xe2\x89\xa0As2A_{s1} \eq A_{s2} or Bs1\xe2\x89\xa0Bs2B_{s1} \eq B_{s2}.It is allowed to add any number (possibly zero) of leading zeroes, i.e. bits 00, to AA and any number of leading zeroes to BB before shuffling the bits.
