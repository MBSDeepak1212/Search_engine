 You're given a binary string, i.e. a sequence of bits where each bit is either 0 or 1, of length n. Define the number of runs of the binary string as the minimum number of parts you can partition the string into so that all the bits of one part are the same. For example, consider the binary string 10110001. The number of runs of this string is 5. This is because we can split the string into 5 parts : 1, 0, 11, 000, 1, such that the bits of each part is the same. Similarly, verify that the number of runs of 1010101, 11110000, 0010111 is 7, 2 and 4 respectively.Fluffy has a binary string S of length n, but some of the bits are missing, and are replaced with a question mark. For each integer i that satisfies 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n, Fluffy wants to know the number of ways to replace the question marks with 1 or 0 so that the number of runs of S is equal to i.\xc2\xa0
