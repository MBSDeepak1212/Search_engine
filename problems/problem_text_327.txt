As a BITS - Pilani student and a football player, Bayne was delighted once he heard the news, BITS-Pilani is finally participating in the National Football League (NFL).A team is to be formed of "n" players, all of which are BITS students. However, the team might have players belonging to different departments. There are "m" departments in BITS, numbered from 1 to m. Bane\'s department has number "h". For each department "i", Bane knows number s[i] \xe2\x80\x94 how many students who play football belong to this department.Bane was also able to guarantee a spot on the team, using his special powers. But since he hates floating-point numbers, he needs your help at finding the probability that he will have at least one teammate belonging to his department.Note that every possible team containing Bane is equally probable. Consider all the students different from each other.
