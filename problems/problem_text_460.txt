Consider a string sss. The following operation can be performed on it successively several (possibly zero) times. Select any non empty suffix of sss and append it to sssFor example, if s=abcds=abcds = \\text{abcd}, then sss can become either abcddabcdd\\text{abcdd}, abcdcdabcdcd\\text{abcdcd}, abcdbcdabcdbcd\\text{abcdbcd} or abcdabcdabcdabcd\\text{abcdabcd} after one operation. Successive operations are now performed on the new string.You are given a string ttt, the resultant string after applying several (possibly zero) operations on some string. You must find any such string sss of the shortest length from which ttt can be obtained after some sequence of operations. It can be proven that such a string always exists.
