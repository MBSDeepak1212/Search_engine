You are given a rooted tree with NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN). Node 111 is the root. You are also given integer sequences x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xNx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xNx_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_N and v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vNv1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vNv_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_N.Let SSS be a subset of nodes. It is called valid if it is non-empty and the following conditions hold:There is no pair of nodes (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) such that i,j\xe2\x88\x88Si,j\xe2\x88\x88Si,j \\in S and iii is an ancestor of jjj.The greatest common divisor of the values xixix_i for all nodes i\xe2\x88\x88Si\xe2\x88\x88Si \\in S (let's denote it by GGG) is greater than 111.Next, let's define the value of SSS as G\xe2\x8b\x85VG\xe2\x8b\x85VG \\cdot V, where GGG is defined above and V=\xe2\x88\x91i\xe2\x88\x88SviV=\xe2\x88\x91i\xe2\x88\x88SviV = \\sum_{i \\in S}{v_i}.You need to find a valid subset of nodes with the maximum value.
