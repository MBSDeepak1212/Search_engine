 Shaurya is a great competitive programmer of NIT Kurukshetra. He tries his best to teach Algorithms and Data Structures to his juniors in the best possible way. He always gives creative questions to his students so that students never get bored. As this year is bad because of COVID-19, he tries to give a problem on Coronavirus to his students. He came up with an interesting question.There is a matrix AAA of size N\xe2\x88\x97MN\xe2\x88\x97MN*M, consisting of NNN rows and MMM columns.  The rows are numbered from 1,2,..,N1,2,..,N1,2,..,N and columns are numbered from 1,2,...,M1,2,...,M1,2,...,M. Each cell is represented by AAAi,ji,ji,j. The cell can be empty, blocked, or contain the deadly coronavirus. The virus can move only in the same row or in the same column until it gets blocked. The virus can only move in empty positions and contaminate the cell. You have to count the number of cells that get contaminated. Each cell can contain at most 111 virus, and cells can be contaminated by more than 1 virus. The cells containing the virus initially are also contaminated.
