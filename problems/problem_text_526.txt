You are given two sequences of N elements P and Q. You have to partition them where the cost of making a partition from index L to R is cost = min(P[L...N])*max(Q[1...R]). Find the minimum and the maximum cost of partitioning the two sequences into exactly K partitions. Remember, the partitions of the two sequences must be the same, you cannot make different partitions for P and Q.
