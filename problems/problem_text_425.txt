You are given a rooted tree with N nodes. You would like to paint each node of the tree in one of three possible colors: red, green, and blue. The following conditions must be fulfilled:For each node painted red, there must be no more than R red nodes in its subtree (including this node).For each node painted green, there must be no more than G green nodes in its subtree (including this node).For each node painted blue, there must be no more than B blue nodes in it's subtree (including this node).Find the number of ways to paint the tree and output it modulo 1000000007.
