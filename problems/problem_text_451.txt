The longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of a sequence B1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BLB1,B2,\xe2\x80\xa6,BLB_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_L is the longest sequence of valid indices i1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,iki1,i2,\xe2\x80\xa6,iki_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_k such that i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<iki1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<iki_1 \\lt i_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt i_k and Bi1<Bi2<\xe2\x80\xa6<BikBi1<Bi2<\xe2\x80\xa6<BikB_{i_1} \\lt B_{i_2} \\lt \\ldots \\lt B_{i_k}.You are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. You may modify it by performing the following operation zero or more times:Let KKK be the length of the LIS of the current sequence AAA.Choose a position in this sequence (possibly the beginning or end of the sequence) and insert a new element KKK into this sequence at this position.This way, the sequence AAA changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.For example, if A=[3,3,4]A=[3,3,4]A = [3, 3, 4], then the LIS of AAA has length 222, so we can insert 222 anywhere into AAA, obtaining one of the sequences [2,3,3,4][2,3,3,4][2, 3, 3,  4], [3,2,3,4][3,2,3,4][3, 2, 3, 4], [3,3,2,4][3,3,2,4][3, 3, 2, 4] or [3,3,4,2][3,3,4,2][3, 3, 4, 2].Find the maximum length of the LIS of AAA that can be obtained after performing the given operation a finite number of times.
