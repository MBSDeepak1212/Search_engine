There are N states in Mirzapur, whose vote counts on Day 0 are given. (count[0,\xe2\x80\xa6.,n-1]) .Next D days, either the vote count of a state gets updated, or the election commission wants Jas and Ashish to submit their Max-Potential Value.Max-Potential =  maximum of gcd(count[i],count[j]), for all i, j.  (0\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921,i\xe2\x89\xa0j0\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x921,i\xe2\x89\xa0j 0 \\leq i, j \\leq n-1, i \eq j ).Mathematically, the two operations can be defined as:[1 i x]: Update voteCount of state i to x. (count[i] = x). [2]: Output Max-Potential.See the explanation of sample test cases, for more clarity.Warning: Use Fast IO
