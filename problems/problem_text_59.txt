NN integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N are placed in a circle in such a way that for each valid ii, AiA_i and Ai+1A_{i+1} are adjacent, and A1A_1 and ANA_N are also adjacent.We want to repeat the following operation exactly N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 times (until only one number remains):Select two adjacent numbers. Let's denote them by aa and bb.Score a+ba+b penalty points.Erase both aa and bb from the circle and insert a+ba+b in the space between them.What is the minimum number of penalty points we can score?
