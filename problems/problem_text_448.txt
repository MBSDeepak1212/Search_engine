Chef has a tree with NNN nodes numbered 111 through NNN. Each node of the tree has a weight; let's denote the weight of node vvv by avava_v.Chef should answer QQQ queries. Each query is described by an integer rrr and a list of kkk nodes u1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uku1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uku_1, u_2, \\dots, u_k. In each query, let SSS be the connected subgraph of the tree (i.e. a subtree) which contains the nodes u1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uku1,u2,\xe2\x80\xa6,uku_1, u_2, \\dots, u_k and has the minimum possible size (it can be proven that these conditions uniquely define SSS). The answer to a query is minu\xe2\x88\x88S(|au\xe2\x88\x92r|)minu\xe2\x88\x88S(|au\xe2\x88\x92r|)\\mathrm{min}_{u \\in S}(|a_u - r|).Help Chef and answer all the queries. Note the special format of the input, which is intended to ensure you can only know each query (except the first) after answering the previous query.
