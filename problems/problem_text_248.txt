You are given a set SSS, which is a subset of {1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N}{1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N}\\{1, 2, \\ldots, N\\}.Consider a permutation P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N of the integers 111 through NNN. The cost of this permutation is the number of indices i>1i>1i \\gt 1 such that PiPiP_i is divisible by Pi\xe2\x88\x921Pi\xe2\x88\x921P_{i-1} and PiPi\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x88SPiPi\xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x88S\\frac{P_i}{P_{i-1}} \\in S.For each kkk between 000 and N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 (inclusive), find the number of permutations with cost kkk. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.
