 Sultan has asked Ramadhir to supply him with automatic guns in an attempt to dominate the battlefield. The Sardar family must also buy automatic guns or risk annihilation.The gun merchant Sardar is buying guns from has NNN guns in stock, the iii-th of which has type AiAiA_i. He sells these guns according to the following peculiar rules:Only one person can buy guns at a time.For all 1<i\xe2\x89\xa4N1<i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 < i \\leq N, he will sell the iii-th gun only if the (i\xe2\x88\x921)(i\xe2\x88\x921)(i-1)-th gun has already been sold to somebody. The first gun can be sold directly with no restriction.Once some guns are sold to a person and they leave, they will not be allowed to come back in later and purchase any more guns.As a result, any buyer can only own a consecutive set of guns - if the first unsold gun when they enter has index LLL, they can only buy guns L,L+1,L+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,RL,L+1,L+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,RL, L+1, L+2, \\dots, R where L\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4NL\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4NL \\leq R \\leq N, and the choice of RRR is left to them.Sardar Khan wants his lackeys to visit the gun merchant and buy all the guns. The intimidation power of a lackey is the number of distinct types of guns in his possession. The total intimidation power Sardar Khan gets from his lackeys is the product of all of their individual intimidation powers (to ensure this value is non-zero, only consider the product over all lackeys who purchase at least one weapon from this merchant).Sardar can send as few or as many lackeys to the merchant as he likes, as long as every weapon is purchased by at least one of them.Sardar obviously would like to maximize his intimidation power. Find out what this maximum value is, given that his lackeys buy guns optimally. The answer can be large, so print it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
