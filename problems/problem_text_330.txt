There are NNN dragons in Wonderland (numbered 111 through NNN). Each dragon lives in one of NNN caves, which are located in a single row and numbered 111 through NNN in the order from left to right. Let's denote the strength of the iii-th dragon by SiSiS_i.Also, a beautiful princess lives in Wonderland. Many princes would like to marry her. But the princess feels self-sufficient, so she doesn't want to get married. She loves living in dragon caves and talking to dragons.One day, the princess heard that a new prince is travelling to Wonderland to propose to her. She doesn't want to even see the prince \xe2\x80\x94 instead, she's going to choose some cave to live in and assign exactly one dragon to each cave to protect her from the prince.Let's denote the cave the princess chose by FFF and the strength of the dragon inhabiting the iii-th cave after the princess assigns the dragons to caves by XiXiX_i. The prince will start his journey near some cave VVV and move straight towards cave FFF, fighting the dragons in all caves between VVV and FFF (both inclusive). The prince initially has strength PPP; by defeating a dragon with strength XXX, the prince's strength decreases by XXX. If the prince's strength becomes non-positive at any time, he dies.The princess does not know the cave the prince will choose to start from. Therefore, she wants to assign the dragons to caves in such a way that the number of caves the prince can start from and die while going to the princess (possibly after defeating all dragons) is maximum possible. Help the princess calculate this number for each possible choice of her cave FFF.
