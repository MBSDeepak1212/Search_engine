He has a magic board A that consists of N rows and M columns. Each cell of the board contains an integer from 0 to 9 inclusive. The cell at the intersection of the i-th row and the j-th column is denoted as (i; j), where 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N and 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 M. The number in the cell (i; j) is denoted as A[i][j].The Little Elephant owns the only magic operation which can be described as follows. He chooses some integer P and some row or column, after that for each cell in the chosen row or column he adds number P to the number in this cell and take the result modulo 10 in order to keep numbers in the range {0, 1, ..., 9}. Our Little Magician wants to perform series of such operations to achieve some board for which certain characteristic called level of the board is maximal possible.So what is the level of the board? Bluntly speaking it is the length of the longest non-increasing subsequence of cells of the board. Formally, the level of the board is the maximal integer K such that there exists such sequence of different cells (i1; j1), (i2; j2), ..., (iK; jK) for which1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ... \xe2\x89\xa4 iK \xe2\x89\xa4 N, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j1 \xe2\x89\xa4 ... \xe2\x89\xa4 jK \xe2\x89\xa4 M, andA[i1][j1] \xe2\x89\xa5 A[i2][j2] \xe2\x89\xa5 ... \xe2\x89\xa5 A[iK][jK].Though, the magic operation, the Little Elephant owns, is quite powerful, there are some restrictions dictated by the Association of Cursed Magicians (ACM):The number P should be chosen in advance and should be the same for all operations.For each row the magic operation can be applied at most once.The same, of course, is true for columns.Without these stupid restrictions of this stupid Association our hero could always achieve the maximal possible level M + N \xe2\x88\x92 1. But now he is confused and asks you for help. Find the maximal level of the board A after making arbitrary number of magic operations according to the restrictions of ACM.
