 Let's define 'Group' as the subarray containing only 0s or only 1s. You are also given two values xxx and yyy. Your task is to flip the values (from 000 to 111 or from 111 to 000) in the array such that length of every 'Group' is between xxx and yyy (inclusive). But thats not it :p. You are also given another array BBB of size NNN which consists of the cost of flipping the respective values of array A. Formally, for each position iii from 111 to NNN ,the cost of flipping the value of AiAiAi is BiBiBi. You need to find the minimum cost such that the resultant array A\xe2\x80\xb2A\xe2\x80\xb2A' satisfy the given condition. Note: It is possible that answer does not exist. In that case print -1.
