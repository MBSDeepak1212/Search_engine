For example, P\xe2\x86\x92a\xe2\x8b\x85Q+b\xe2\x8b\x85RP\xe2\x86\x92a\xe2\x8b\x85Q+b\xe2\x8b\x85RP \\rightarrow a\\cdot Q + b\\cdot R is a decomposition reaction. Here, 11 unit of PP is converted into aa unit of QQ and bb unit of RR after completion of the reaction.You are given NN compounds numbered from 11 to NN. The initial amount of the ithi^{th} compound is QiQ_i. You are also given MM equations. Every equation is of the form: C0\xe2\x86\x92W1\xe2\x8b\x85C1+W2\xe2\x8b\x85C2+\xe2\x80\xa6+WX\xe2\x8b\x85CXC_0 \\rightarrow W_1\\cdot C_1 + W_2\\cdot C_2 + \\ldots + W_X\\cdot C_X.Here:C0C_0 represents the compound which will decompose into XX compounds on heating.CiC_i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4X)(1 \\leq i \\leq X ) represents the compounds into which C0C_0 is decomposed.WiW_i (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4X)(1 \\leq i \\leq X ) represents the number of units of CiC_i produced due to the decomposition of C0C_0.Ci>Ci\xe2\x88\x921C_i > C_{i-1} for all (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4X)(1 \\leq i \\leq X).Note that a compound can decompose in at most one way only.Find the final amount of each compound after prolonged heating. Since the number can be huge, print the answer modulo 109+710^9+7.
