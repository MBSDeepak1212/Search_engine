You are given a rooted tree with NNN nodes (numbered 11 through NN); node 11 is the root. Each node has a value; let's denote the value of node ii by AiA_i.You may perform the following operation any number of times (including zero): choose any node which still exists in the tree and remove the whole subtree of this node including itself.Let's define the profit as the sum of values of all nodes which currently exist in the tree minus X\xe2\x8b\x85kX \\cdot k, where kk denotes the number of times this operation was performed. Find the maximum possible profit.
