 Elections in Bytetown are coming soon!\xc2\xa0 Candidate Boris is going to have a small walk. Bytetown can be represented as N-dimensional cube with edge size D. Initially Boris stands in cell with coordinates (0, 0, ... 0) and his destination is cell (D-1, D-1,... D-1). His route consists of chain of the cells, where each pair of consecutive cells differs in exactly one coordinate by 1 and sum of coordinates strictly increases during his walk. Note that Boris walks through the cells not points.But not all the people in Bytetown are going to vote for Boris. Some of them are sure that Boris is a liar and bribetaker and they will tell it to Boris if they meet him. Boris doesn't like such people and avoids them. He knows that at cell with coordinares (i0, i1,..., iN-1) he will meet (i0^ i1^...^iN-1)x(i0+ i1+...+ iN-1) such people (in other words XOR-sum of coordinates times arithmetic sum of coordinates). Try to help him to find minimal number of unfriendly people he will have to meet.
