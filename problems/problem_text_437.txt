Chef has an integer array X, and a binary array S, both of size N. He wants to know how many vectors (denote by V) of N elements exist, for which the following conditions hold for all valid indices i (that is, for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N).0 \xe2\x89\xa4 Vi < 1018If Si = 1, Vi is \xe2\x89\xa5 Xi, and if Si = 0, Vi \xe2\x89\xa4 XiSum of the elements of V, when viewed as a string, contains "47" as a substring.Please help Chef find this count. Since it may be a very large number, you should output the count modulo 109+7.
