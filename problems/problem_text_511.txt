 In his country instead of one capital, any number of cities can be capital. There are many cities in his country, but only the capital cities have all the facilities like hospitals, markets etc.So in order to get anything you have to visit the capital city.In order to simplify it, every city has been assigned to exactly one capital city. Apart from this, every capital city has an entry fee which means that whenever a person from another city enters its assigned capital city, he has to pay some entry fee. Consider one unit cost is used to travel one unit distance.  You will be given the location of  N cities as N integers   x1 , x2 , x3 .... , xN. You will also be provided with a positive integer K Now your objective is to choose  exactly K cities as capital and assign every city to exactly one capital city such that following function F is minimized: C[1] = cost to travel from 1st city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital. C[2] = cost to travel from 2nd city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital.  ..... ..... C[N] = cost to travel from Nth city to its assigned capital city + fee to enter its assigned capital.  F = C[1] + C[2] + .... C[N]  NOTE: If the ith city is capital city then C[i] = 0.Output the minimum possible value of the function F. \xc2\xa0
