As we all know, Chefland consists of NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 roads in such a way that each city is reachable from all other cities. In other words, the cities and roads form a tree. For each valid iii, the iii-th city's height above sea level is AiAiA_i.A path between two cities is said to be beautiful if the heights of the cities in the path first increase and then decrease. In other words, when we denote the sequence of cities the path passes through by x1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xLx1,x2,\xe2\x80\xa6,xLx_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_L, it is beautiful if Ax1<Ax2<\xe2\x80\xa6<Axp>\xe2\x80\xa6>AxL\xe2\x88\x921>AxLAx1<Ax2<\xe2\x80\xa6<Axp>\xe2\x80\xa6>AxL\xe2\x88\x921>AxLA_{x_1} \\lt A_{x_2} \\lt \\ldots \\lt A_{x_p} \\gt \\ldots \\gt A_{x_{L-1}} \\gt A_{x_L} holds for some integer ppp (1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4L1\xe2\x89\xa4p\xe2\x89\xa4L1 \\le p \\le L).Chefina is planning a trip along a path in the tree. You should answer QQQ queries. In each query, you are given two cities xxx and yyy and you should tell Chefina if the simple path between these cities is beautiful.
