 But unfortunately, Parth never succeeds to beat Ansh. But this time Parth came up with a new game which he expects Ansh to lose.Ansh has to find the number of ways to construct  an array such that every consecutive element in the array has a different value. Also every element in the array should be in the range [L,R][L,R][L, R] (both inclusive). Apart from these, Parth also need the elements with index iii and jjj to be integers XXX and YYY respectively, where iii and jjj lies in the range [1,N][1,N][1, N] while XXX and YYY lies in the range [L,R][L,R][L, R] as stated above.It is guaranteed that if jjj = i+1i+1i + 1 then XXX and YYY are different.
