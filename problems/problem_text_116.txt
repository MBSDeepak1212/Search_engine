Let\'s define Fibonacci concatenation sequence as follows:f[0]=0f[0] = 0, f[1]=1f[1] = 1f[i]=f[i\xe2\x88\x921]+f[i\xe2\x88\x922]f[i] = f[i-1] + f[i-2], for every i\xe2\x89\xa52i \\geq 2Here f[i]f[i] denotes the ithi^{th} Fibonacci concatenation number and ++ represents concatenation.For example, f[2]=f[1]+f[0]=1+0=10f[2] = f[1] + f[0] = 1 + 0 = 10, f[3]=f[2]+f[1]=f[3] = f[2] + f[1] = 10+1=10 + 1 =  101101.Given an integer nn, you have to determine the sum of digits of all subsequences of the nthn^{th} Fibonacci concatenation number f[n]f[n],  modulo 109+710^9 + 7.A subsequence of a number is a sequence of digits that can be derived from the number by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) digits without changing the order of the remaining digits. The subsequence may even start with trailing zeros. For example 1010, 0101 are subsequences of 101101 while 110110 is NOT a subsequence of 101101. Note that there are 88 subsequences of 101101. The subsequence 11 appears twice and should be counted as different while computing the sum.
