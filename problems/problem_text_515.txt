 His brilliant plan is to pour concrete over him to immobilize him, and then throw him off the building so that the concrete breaks leaving a shocked and wounded Superman exposed on the ground below for further attack. However, he realizes that the concrete may not break making the feat unimpressive, or if he went too high the fall would kill his enemy, which he can never do. So he decides to carry out trials with many identical Superman-sized concrete blocks to find out the minimum floor from which if thrown the block will break when it hits the ground below. He wants to know what is the maximum number of times he will have to drop a block from the building if he uses an optimal method to determine the critical floor from and above which the blocks always break. NOTE:\xc2\xa0A block which did not break after falling can be reused. It is possible that block may not break even when thrown from the highest floor.\xc2\xa0
