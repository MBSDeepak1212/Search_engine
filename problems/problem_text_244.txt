 Each of the contests has three problems, categorized as easy, medium and hard on difficulty level. For the ith contest, easy problem takes TE[i] hours and gives you PE[i] pleasure. Similarly, medium problem takes TM[i] hours, gives PM[i] pleasure, and a hard one has the values TH[i], PH[i].Today, Animesh wanted to practice some of them. Animesh has a really bad habit of trying problems for only a few minutes and saying to Malvika "I am a noob, you are a pro. It\'s some weird shit I don\'t know. Please, tell me the solution, bro!" Having been irritated by this behaviour numerous times in the past, she granted him K special powers he can use before starting the practice session. By using a single power, Animesh can pick any two problems irrespective of their difficulty from two different contests and swap them. Animesh has at max time hours before he gets frustrated by his noobness and ends the practice session. He wants to make the maximum use of it by getting as much pleasure out of this activity as possible. Animesh also gets bored with the contest themes fairly quickly, so he does not want to solve more than one problem from any contest. Can you help Animesh in estimating the maximum amount of pleasure he can achieve out of this activity?
