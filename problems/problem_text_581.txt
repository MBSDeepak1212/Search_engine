 Hope you are doing well :P).Considering there are NNN teams participating and there are MMM problems in the contest. What would be the expected number of problems solved by the team at rank KKK on the leaderboard?If the expected value is P/QP/Q{P/Q} you must print the value P\xe2\x88\x97Q\xe2\x88\x921%MODP\xe2\x88\x97Q\xe2\x88\x921%MOD{P*Q^{-1} \\% MOD}, where MOD=109+7MOD=109+7{MOD=10^9 + 7}.
