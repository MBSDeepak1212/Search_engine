There are NNN guests (numbered 11 through NN) coming to Chef's wedding. Each guest is part of a family; for each valid ii, the ii-th guest is part of family FiF_i. You need to help Chef find an optimal seating arrangement.Chef may buy a number of tables, which are large enough for any number of guests, but the people sitting at each table must have consecutive numbers \xe2\x80\x95 for any two guests ii and jj (i<ji \\lt j) sitting at the same table, guests i+1,i+2,\xe2\x80\xa6,j\xe2\x88\x921i+1, i+2, \\ldots, j-1 must also sit at that table. Chef would have liked to seat all guests at a single table; however, he noticed that two guests ii and jj are likely to get into an argument if Fi=FjF_i = F_j and they are sitting at the same table.Each table costs KK rupees. Chef defines the inefficiency of a seating arrangement as the total cost of tables plus the number of guests who are likely to get into an argument with another guest. Tell Chef the minimum possible inefficiency which he can achieve.
