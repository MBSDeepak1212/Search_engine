 Tom has two sets of nnn crop seeds each. In the two sets, the two ithithi^{th} crop seeds are the same type crop.The first set of nnn crop seeds are independent and each of them require their own preparation and can be grown independently. The ithithi^{th} crop under this category will take a cost of xixix_i.The second set of nnn crops are genetically modified to withstand extreme conditions and even withstand the intense dust storms. But there is one thing: to allot a proper usage of resources, the crops are designed in such a way that the ithithi^{th} crop can be directly grown without fertiliser or other resource if the genetically modified (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i-1)^{th} crop is grown: that is, for example, the waste material of the (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i-1)^{th} crop can be fertiliser for the ithithi^{th} crop, etc. Thus he can grow the ithithi^{th} crop in them in a constant ccc cost along with a preparation cost of ckickick_i but if he has also grown the (i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i\xe2\x88\x921)th(i-1)^{th} genetically modified crop, he can skip the preparation cost and grow the ithithi^{th} crop in just ccc cost.Since the world market expects a lot of variety in the crops available, Tom wants to maximize the number of different types of crops he grows. That is for example, Tom can grow only genetically modified crop 1 on all his fields. In that case, he grows 1 crop. Tom wants to maximize this number of crops he grows. Note that growing both genetically modified and normal versions of the same crop count as growing 1 crop only, and not 2.Thus, Tom wants you to find out the maximum number of different crops he can grow, and the corresponding minimum cost at which he can grow n sets of crops.
