 The simulator generates a tower of NNN blocks. Each block in the tower has a unique value assigned to it. Both of them decide to rearrange the tower to make it look aesthetically more pleasing, with each having thought of a different way of doing it. Ajeyaa wants to arrange them such that the block values are in ascending order from top to bottom, while Sriram wants the block values in descending order from top to bottom.To move a block, one can take it out and insert it between any 2 blocks. It can also be placed on top or inserted at the bottom. It takes 2 seconds to move one block from its original position to any other position. Unable to decide upon which method to use, both of them agree to use the method which uses the shortest time (that is, they will arrange the blocks either in ascending or descending order from top to bottom, depending on which method takes the shortest time). Find whose arrangement will be final and also find the minimum number of blocks which need to be moved.
