Consider any way to pair the integers 111 through 2N2N2N into NNN pairs (A1,B1),(A2,B2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(AN,BN)(A1,B1),(A2,B2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(AN,BN)(A_1,B_1), (A_2,B_2), \\ldots, (A_N,B_N) in such a way that each of these integers is present in exactly one pair, Ai<BiAi<BiA_i \\lt B_i for each valid iii and A1<A2<\xe2\x80\xa6<ANA1<A2<\xe2\x80\xa6<ANA_1 \\lt A_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt A_N. Let\'s call such a sequence of pairs a pairing.For a pairing (A1,B1),(A2,B2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(AN,BN)(A1,B1),(A2,B2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(AN,BN)(A_1,B_1), (A_2,B_2), \\ldots, (A_N,B_N), we can create an undirected graph with 2N2N2N nodes (numbered 111 through 2N2N2N) and the following edges:first type: for each valid iii, an edge between nodes iii and i+1i+1i+1second type: for each valid iii, an edge between nodes AiAiA_i and BiBiB_iThis pairing is valid if for each edge (i,i+1)(i,i+1)(i,i+1) of the first type, there is an edge of the second type (Aj,Bj)(Aj,Bj)(A_j, B_j) which "surrounds" it, i.e. satisfies Aj\xe2\x89\xa4iAj\xe2\x89\xa4iA_j \\le i and Bj>iBj>iB_j \\gt i. The cost of a valid pairing is defined as the number of pairs of edges of the second type such that one of these edges is "nested" in the other, i.e. pairs (Ai,Bi)(Ai,Bi)(A_i, B_i) and (Aj,Bj)(Aj,Bj)(A_j, B_j) such that Ai<Aj<Bj<BiAi<Aj<Bj<BiA_i \\lt A_j \\lt B_j \\lt B_i.Find the sum of costs of all valid pairings. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo a given prime PPP.
