 A coin may have integral value denoted by  C[i][j]C[i][j]C[i][j]. If you're at a cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), then you have to pick up the coin present at that cell(whose value is C[i][j]C[i][j]C[i][j]) and you can visit a cell onlyonlyonly onceonceonce .You are initially at (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) and you have to reach (M,N)(M,N)(M,N). Note that you can only move rightrightright, upupup or bottombottombottom from a given cell. Formally, if you are at position  (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) ,then you can move to (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i+1,j), (i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i-1,j) or (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i,j+1). Following the conditions given above, what is the total maximummaximummaximum value of coins you can have after reaching (M,N)(M,N)(M,N)?
