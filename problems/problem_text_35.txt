 You have to merge both the binary strings to form a new binary string $C$ of length $2 \\cdot N$. The relative order of characters in the original binary strings $A$ and $B$ should not change in the binary string $C$.For example, if $A = {\\color{blue}01011}$ and $B = {\\color{red}10100}$, one possible way to merge them to form $C$ is: $C = {\\color{blue}0}{\\color{red}1}{\\color{red}0}{\\color{blue}1}{\\color{red}1}{\\color{blue}0}{\\color{blue}1}{\\color{blue}1}{\\color{red}0}{\\color{red}0}$.Minimize the number of inversions in the merged binary string $C$.As a reminder, a pair of indices $(i, j)$ is an inversion for binary string $C$ if and only if $1 \\leq i \\lt j \\leq |C|$, $C_i = 1$ and $C_j = 0$.
