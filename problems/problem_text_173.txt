 There are total NNN temples. Unlike humans, the Solomons (Giant aliens of the Light World) can travel from one temple to another through Cosmic Bridges and the distance observed by them between any two temples is 000 units (Interesting? Well, they travel with more than the speed of light) But the year 202020202020, proved to be a curse for Solomons. This year, a Mega Star Urus struck their Universe and damaged many Cosmic Bridges. However the God of Light ensured that for any two distinct temples uuu and vvv there exists exactly one unique path through Cosmic Bridge(s), but the distance between two directly connected temples through a Bridge has now increased to 111 units.To prevail the existence of this Universe, the God of Light carved himself into exactly NNN Solomons which now rule the NNN temples and are independent of each other. One by one, the ithithi^{th} Solomon (0\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9210\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N\xe2\x88\x9210 \\leq i \\leq N-1) transmits Light pulses through the network of Cosmic Bridges and determines the sum of distances to the remaining N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 Solomons. Can you help them find these quantities so they can reunite into God of Light again?
