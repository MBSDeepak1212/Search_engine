 He bought a new one and has already installed all necessary software. But he has lost his personal collection of media files. It is just unbearable! How can he avoid such a loss in future?Dipu is planning to maintain a "fresh" second hard disk in his computer as a backup device. He wants to make sure that the backup hard disk is never too old, by replacing it with a new one every few months. This is what he will do: after a backup hard disk has been used for a few months, Dipu will buy a new hard disk, move all the data from the old backup disk to the new one and then sell the old one. He knows that he will have to sell an old backup disk at a price lower than its original price because of both depreciation and the drop in the market price of new hard disks. His goal is to keep the total cost of maintaining the backups as low as possible.Given the prices of different models of hard disks in the next few months, your job is to determine the minimum cost of maintaining the backup disks in the same period of time. Assume: Dipu will only buy a new backup hard disk and sell the old one on the first day of a month. He has no backup disk to sell on the first day of the first month. So he needs to buy a new backup disk on the first day of the first month, without selling.The amount he will get by selling a hard disk is exactly Tk 100 less than the current price of a new hard disk of the same model at the selling time. the price of same model hard disks never goes up versus months, and always remains expensive than Tk 100.
