Let's define a function P(A)P(A)P(A) for a sequence AAA as the number of ways to divide AAA into contiguous subsequences such that each element of AAA belongs to exactly one of these subsequences and the sum of elements of each subsequence is between LLL and RRR inclusive.For each integer nnn between 111 and NNN inclusive, solve the following problem: Consider a random sequence AAA with length nnn where each element is an integer between 111 and KKK chosen uniformly randomly and independently. Find the expected value of P(A)P(A)P(A).For each valid nnn, it can be proved that the expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/QP/QP / Q, where PPP and QQQ are positive integers and QQQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot Q^{-1} modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921Q^{-1} is the multiplicative inverse of QQQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.
