Chef is a big fan of soccer! He loves soccer so much that he even invented soccer for dogs! Here are the rules of soccer for dogs:NNN dogs (numbered 111 through NNN) stand in a line in such a way that for each valid iii, dogs iii and i+1i+1i + 1 are adjacent.Each dog has a skill level, which is either 111 or 222.At the beginning of the game, Chef passes a ball to dog 111 (dog 111 receives the ball).For each valid iii, if dog iii has skill level sss, this dog can pass the ball to any dog with number jjj such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4|i\xe2\x88\x92j|\xe2\x89\xa4s1\xe2\x89\xa4|i\xe2\x88\x92j|\xe2\x89\xa4s1 \\le |i-j| \\le s.Each dog (including dog 111) may receive the ball at most once.Whenever a dog receives the ball, it must either pass it to another dog or finish the game by scoring a goal.While the dogs were playing, Chef also created a game for developers. He defined the result of a game of soccer for dogs as the sequence of dogs which received the ball in the order in which they received it. The last dog in the sequence is the dog that decided to score a goal; if a dog never received the ball, it does not appear in the sequence. In the game for developers, you should find the number of possible results of soccer for dogs.Find this number of possible results modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7. Two results of soccer for dogs (sequences of dogs' numbers) are considered different if these sequences have different lengths or if there is a valid index iii such that the iii-th dog in one sequence is different from the iii-th dog in the other sequence.
