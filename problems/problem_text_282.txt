 Now, you can buy a ticket from a station, and go to another station, if there are exactly K tracks on the route, and the route passes through a particular station. You are given N, the number of stations in Mumbai. The number M denotes how many tracks there are in the system. You are also given M pairs of integers, Ai and Bi, denoting that there is a track from Ai to Bi. Now, Dipen is from Jalgaon and hence, wants to know in how many ways, he can get from city X to city Z via city Y if he has a ticket that allows for exactly K tracks in all. Can you help him out?Note:Trains can run in only one direction on a track, from Ai to Bi.
