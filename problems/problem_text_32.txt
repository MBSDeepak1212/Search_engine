As part of a new program to attract tourists to Byteland, Chef has been placed in charge of organizing a series of bus tours around the city.  There are N scenic locations (points on the plane) in Byteland (numbered 0 through N-1), and M bidirectional scenic roads, each of which connects two scenic locations via a straight line. Chef wishes to organize the tours according to the following rules:A tour is defined as sequence of locations, where a tour bus begins at the first location, and moves directly from each location to the next location in the sequence until it reaches the last location. There must be a scenic road between consecutive locations.A tour does not have to start and end at the same location, but it is allowed.A tour cannot visit the same location more than once, with the possible exception of the start/end location.A tour cannot cross itself. That is, none of the roads belonging to a tour may intersect.Each road must be visited by exactly one tour.Setting up tours is expensive, so Chef wishes to minimize the total number of tours.  Optimal solutions are not required, but solutions that use fewer tours will score more points (see the scoring section below).  However, your solution must use at most (N+M)/2 tours or else it will be judged Wrong Answer.
