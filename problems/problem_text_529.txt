 These stalls are lined up from left to right, with stall number 111 as the leftmost, and stall number N+1N+1N + 1 as the rightmost. Stall iii has aiaia_i varieties, and no 222 stalls serve the same variety. Felicity has a huge budget, therefore every stall has an unlimited quantity of each variety, hence multiple people can order the same variety.Initially, all of the students are on the left of the 1st1st1^{st} stall, so you all decide to send each student to a different stall to check the number of varieties there, i.e. no 222 people will be sent to the same stall.Each student has reached their respective stall, but students are lazy, hence they would only order something from the stall they are at, or go to a stall on their left which has more varieties than the stall they were sent to.What are the total number of unique group orders that can be made by the group of students? Two group orders are considered different if there exists a student who took a different variety in both of the orders.
