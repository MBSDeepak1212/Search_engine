 The number in the iii-th row and jjj-th column is denoted by Ai,jAi,jA_{i, j}. In one operation, you can swap numbers in any two cells which share a side.For a binary string SSS of length NNN, let's define f(S)f(S)f(S) as follows:f(S)f(S)f(S) is the smallest number of swaps required to achieve a state of board in which A1,i<A2,iA1,i<A2,iA_{1, i} < A_{2, i} if Si=1Si=1S_i = 1, and A1,i>A2,iA1,i>A2,iA_{1, i} > A_{2, i} if Si=0Si=0S_i = 0, for each iii from 111 to NNN.It's easy to show that it's possible to achieve any state of the board by swapping adjacent elements, so f(S)f(S)f(S) is always defined.Find the sum of f(S)f(S)f(S) over all 2N2N2^N binary strings SSS of length NNN.
