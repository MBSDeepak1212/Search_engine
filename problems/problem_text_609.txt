 Some are too boring, and in case of offline classes, it's not always possible to run away too. On another such class, Vaibhav and Atul got too bored and so, they decided to play the same game, but with a twist.Atul gave Vaibhav an integer array AAA of length NNN, and three more integers KKK, LLL and CCC. He asked Vaibhav to form KKK new arrays of LLL length from the array AAA, such that the sum of all integers present in the new KKK arrays combined should be as maximum as possible. Each new array should be a subarray of array AAA and any element of array AAA can be part of at most two new arrays. In total, there can be at most CCC elements which are part of more than one new array.As the size of array AAA can be large, Vaibhav needs your help in the calculation. Help Vaibhav to solve the problem.
