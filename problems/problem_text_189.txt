 There he saw a lot of food shortage among the people due to the impact of COVID-19. His father is a government official, so he decided to help those poor people by supplying the food on their building with the help of jet-planes. The buildings are represented by three pairs of points, (x1,y1),(x2,y2)and(x3,y3)(x1,y1),(x2,y2)and(x3,y3)(x1, y1), (x2,y2) and (x3, y3). The jets flight direction is either parallel to x axis or y-axis. These jets drop the food packets on the every buiding they fly over on their flight. If a packet falls on the boundary of building then it will fell down and get wasted. No two buildings touch each other. Omi wants to figure out the number of buildings receiving the food packets on each flight. He wants your help to figure it out as he is not good in geometry.
