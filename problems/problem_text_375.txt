 The iii-th person from the left has a height HiHiH_i. HHH is a permutation of 111 to NNN. First, you must assign each of them a shirt with the letter LLL or RRR on it. Then you may perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):Choose a person with LLL on their shirt and move them to the left end of the line.Choose a person with RRR on their shirt and move them to the right end of the line.For example, if H=[4,1,2,3]H=[4,1,2,3]H = [4, 1, 2, 3] and we assign the shirts to the people as [(4,R),(1,L),(2,L),(3,R)][(4,R),(1,L),(2,L),(3,R)][(4, R), (1, L), (2, L), (3, R)], then if we move person 111 to the right end of the line the arrangement of people becomes [(1,L),(2,L),(3,R),(4,R)][(1,L),(2,L),(3,R),(4,R)][(1, L), (2, L), (3, R), (4, R)]An assignment of shirts is called good if it is possible to sort the people in the line in non-decreasing order of height from left to right by using this operation zero or more times.How many good assignments of shirts exist? Since this number may be large, print it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.One assignment of shirts is different from another assignment if there exists at least one person who is assigned a shirt with a different letter on it.
