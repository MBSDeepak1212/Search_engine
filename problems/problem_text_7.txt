A palindrome is a string that reads same in both directions: forwards and backwards. For example, the strings radar and noon are palindromes, whereas the string chef is not a palindrome as being read backwards is becomes equal to fehc, which is not equal to chef.Let\'s say that the pair of indices (i, j) denotes a palindrome in some string S iff i \xe2\x89\xa4 j and the substring starting at the i-th character and ending at the j-th character of S is a palindrome.Given an integer N. Your task is to construct a string S such that there are exactly N different pairs (i, j) that denotes a palindrome.
