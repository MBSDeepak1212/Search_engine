Chef loves to make dishes. Currently, he has NNN ingredients (numbered 111 through NNN) which he can use to cook various dishes.To make a dish, Chef must use exactly KKK ingredients in a correct order. Therefore, a dish is a sequence of KKK distinct integers between 111 and NNN. The tastiness of that dish is defined as the GCD of these integers (all the ingredients in that dish). Chef wants to choose a dish uniformly randomly and cook it.You should answer QQQ queries. KKK is the same for all queries. In each query, you are given NNN and you should find the expected value of the tastiness of Chef's dish or determine that Chef cannot cook any dish.If Chef can cook at least one dish, it can be proven that this expected value is a fraction in the form P/DP/DP/D, where PPP and DDD are coprime positive integers and DDD is coprime with 109+7109+710^9+7. You should compute P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85D\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot D^{-1} modulo 109+7109+710^9+7, where D\xe2\x88\x921D\xe2\x88\x921D^{-1} denotes the multiplicative inverse of DDD modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.
