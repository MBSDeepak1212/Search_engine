 He has a plan to build a series of MMM buildings in Pajal and for this he found a land which can accommodate MMM buildings in a row one after another. The rule of the Pajal government is that no building in Pajal can have more than NNN floors. Based on a few factors like cost of the land, water resources etc. the cost of constructing a building is not the same in all pieces of land and it also depends on the number of floors you want to have in that building.  A community is a maximal group of buildings which have the same number of floors. For example: buildingsbuildingsbuildings = [1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3][1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3][1,1,1,2,2,1,3,3,3] has 4 communities - {(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)}{(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)}\\{(1,1,1),(2,2),(1),(3,3,3)\\}. Mausil wants to have exactly KKK communities in this project.But in this land few buildings were already constructed. Mausil doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to collapse them. He wants to leave all the buildings which were already constructed as they are and construct buildings in the empty pieces of land. So given an array buildingsbuildingsbuildings, an M\xc3\x97NM\xc3\x97NM \\times N matrix costcostcost and an integer KKK where:buildings[i]buildings[i]buildings[i] denotes the number of floors that ithithi^{th} building has if it is positive and if it is 000, it denotes an empty piece of land in which a building has to be constructed.cost[i][j]cost[i][j]cost[i][j] denotes the cost of constructing a building in ithithi^{th} piece of land with jjj floors.If CCC denotes the minimum total cost required for constructing all the buildings in empty pieces of land such that there are exactly KKK communities. You are definitely smarter than Mausil, so please help Mausil to find CCC. If it is not possible to have exactly KKK communities return \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921-1.
