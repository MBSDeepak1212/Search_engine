You are given a string AAA of length NNN, consisting of zeroes and ones. You want to partition it into blocks consisting of consecutive indices such that each block has an odd sum and has length at most mmm. For each mmm from 111 to NNN, find the minimum number of blocks required, or report that it is impossible.
