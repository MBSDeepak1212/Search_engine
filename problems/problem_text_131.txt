You are given a grid of (not necessarily non-negative) integers GGG with NNN rows and MMM columns. Let's denote the integer in the cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) of this grid by Gi,jGi,jG_{i,j}; the rows and columns use 1-based indexing.Formally, let's call a non-empty subset of cells of the grid a plus sign if:it is connectedthere is a central cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) which belongs to the subseteach other (non-central) cell from the subset is either in row iii or column jjjthe central cell is adjacent to 4 other cells in all 4 directionsYou should find the maximum possible sum of integers written in the cells belonging to a plus sign in the grid.
