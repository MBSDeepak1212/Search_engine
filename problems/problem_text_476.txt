Chef likes to play with trees a lot, so his best friend Smurf has given him a tree T consisting of N nodes numbered from 1 to N. Smurf asked him to count the number of ways to assign an integer in the range [1, M] to each of the nodes of the tree such that the absolute difference between the integers assigned to any pair of adjacent nodes is greater or equal than K (i. e \xe2\x89\xa5 K). Since this number can be huge, Chef only needs to find it modulo 109 + 7 (1000000007)Of course this task is tough for our little chef and he cannot solve it without your help. Can you help him?
