 There are NNN minions available for recruitment and each minion has a skill value associated with it. These skill values are given in the array AAA. Gru needs to recruit exactly KKK minions for his next assignment.Now, Gru will pick the minions one by one in some random order. An already picked minion cannot be picked again. At every step, Gru picks one minion uniformly at random from the minions which haven't been picked yet. These minions have a very special demand for working in complete harmony. While picking the minions, if at any moment, the skill value of the newly recruited minion is less than the skill value of any of the already recruited minions, then the minions won't be working in harmony.Formally, suppose we have picked jjj minions so far. Then, if the skill value of the jthjthj^{th} picked minion is less than the skill value of the ithithi^{th} picked minion for any  i<ji<j i < j , then the minions won't work in harmony. Find the probability that the minions will work in harmony. It can be proved that this probability can be represented as an irreducible fraction PQPQ\\frac{P}{Q}. You have to print P\xe2\x88\x97Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x88\x97Q\xe2\x88\x921P*Q^{\xe2\x88\x921} mod 109+7109+710^9+7, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921Q^{\xe2\x88\x921} is the inverse element of QQQ modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.
