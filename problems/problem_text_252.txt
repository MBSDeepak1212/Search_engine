 Dr Mann has in vain tried to dock with the Endurance, resulting in a huge blast. Cooper is trying to save the Endurance by docking with it, but Dr Mann stops him. So Cooper has to attack Dr Mann\xe2\x80\x99s lander to stop him from getting to the Endurance and save the planet.Cooper has nnn missiles arranged in a line each labeled with an impact number (positive, negative, or zero). You can throw as many missiles at Dr Mann as you like, and if a missile hits his spacecraft, it will cause damage to him. Each missile will hit it\xe2\x80\x99s target exactly once. He can launch either one or two consecutive missiles at a time. He can launch only consecutive missiles together. If he launches two missiles, he causes damage equal to the product of the impact numbers on the missiles. Otherwise, if only one missile is launched, he causes damage equal to the impact number on the missile. For example, if the line of missiles is (5;\xe2\x88\x923;\xe2\x88\x925;1;2;9;\xe2\x88\x924)(5;\xe2\x88\x923;\xe2\x88\x925;1;2;9;\xe2\x88\x924)(5; \xe2\x88\x923; \xe2\x88\x925; 1; 2; 9; \xe2\x88\x924), the maximum possible damage is 353535, by launching missile pairs (\xe2\x88\x923;\xe2\x88\x925)(\xe2\x88\x923;\xe2\x88\x925)(\xe2\x88\x923; \xe2\x88\x925) and (2;9)(2;9)(2; 9), and each other missile separately. Note that a higher damage of 393939 is possible if the missile (\xe2\x88\x924)(\xe2\x88\x924)(-4) is not launched, but Cooper has to launch all the missiles to make sure that he also decreases the weight of his lander.Given the line of missile numbers, Cooper wants you to find the maximum possible damage and the set of pairs of missiles required to achieve this score and also the number of missiles.
