For a string S, let\'s define a function F(S) as the minimum number of blocks consisting of consecutive identical characters in S. In other words, F(S) is equal to 1 plus the number of valid indices i such that Si \xe2\x89\xa0 Si+1.You are given two strings A and B with lengths N and M respectively. You should merge these two strings into one string C with length N+M. Specifically, each character of C should come either from A or B; all characters from A should be in the same relative order in C as in A and all characters from B should be in the same relative order in C as in B.Compute the minimum possible value of F(C).
