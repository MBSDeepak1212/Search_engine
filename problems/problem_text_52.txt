You are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. You may perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (including zero): choose two adjacent elements of this sequence, i.e. AiA_i, Ai+1A_{i+1} for some valid ii, and swap them. However, for each valid ii, it is not allowed to choose AiA_i (the element with the index ii, regardless of its value at any point in time) more than once in total during this process.Find the maximum of the sum S=\xe2\x88\x91Ni=1Ai\xe2\x8b\x85iS = \\sum_{i=1}^N A_i \\cdot i.
