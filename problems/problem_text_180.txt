For a sequence of positive integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AKA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AKA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_K, let\'s define the number of inversions in it as the number of pairs of integers (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le i \\lt j \\le K and Ai>AjAi>AjA_i \\gt A_j.You are given a permutation P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N of the integers 111 through NNN. Determine if it is possible to partition this permutation into two subsequences (possibly empty or non-contiguous) such that:Each element of PPP appears in exactly one of these subsequences.The numbers of inversions in one subsequence is equal to the number of inversions in the other subsequence.
