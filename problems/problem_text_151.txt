Chef has a nice job. Actually he doesn't even remember what he is supposed to do there, because he just plays video-games all the time, exactly h hours every working day!Recently he got bored of just randomly playing video-games and decided to complete all the levels of his favorite Game as fast as possible.The Game consists of n levels numbered with integers from 1 to n. After completing every level, some small number of new levels is unlocked. The structure of the Game levels is a tree with the root in level 1, i.e. every level (except for 1) has a unique level that unlocks it and level 1 is the only level that is considered unlocked at the very beginning. Chef has completed his favorite Game lots of times, so he knows that he needs exactly ti hours to complete level i. Due to specifics of the Game every level should be completed entirely within one working day, i.e. Chef cannot start a level on Thursday, and finish it Friday morning.Overall the game-play proceeds as follows:There is a stack S that initially contains only the level 1Chef pops the topmost level out of the stack. Let's call this level xChef spends tx hours to complete level x. Note that he doesn't want to stay at work longer than for h hours, so if there is not enough time left today Chef will complete level x the next working day morning.After completing level x some mx new levels get unlockedChef places all the mx unlocked levels on the top of the stack S in an arbitrary order, i.e. he is free to choose any order he likesIf stack S is empty, the Game is considered completed, otherwise Chef goes back to the step 2Can you help Chef figure out the minimum number of working days necessary to complete the Game?
