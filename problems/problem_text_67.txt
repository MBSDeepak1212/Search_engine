Let's call a positive integer MMM a beautiful number if the following conditions are satisfied:The decimal representation of MM (without leading zeros) does not contain any zeros.The sum of squares of all decimal digits of MM is a perfect square.For example, 11, 44 and 221221 are beautiful, but 1010 and 333333 are not.You are given a positive integer NN. Find the smallest NN-digit beautiful number or determine that all NN-digit integers are not beautiful.
