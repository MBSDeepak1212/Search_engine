You're given an array AAA with NNN integers. Define F(A,i,j)=(A[j]\xe2\x88\x92A[i])\xe2\x8b\x85(j\xe2\x88\x92i)F(A,i,j)=(A[j]\xe2\x88\x92A[i])\xe2\x8b\x85(j\xe2\x88\x92i)F(A, i, j) = (A[j]-A[i]) \\cdot (j-i).Consider the set PPP of all pairs (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\lt j  \\leq N. For a subset SSS of PPP, we define beauty(S,A)beauty(S,A)\\texttt{beauty}(S, A) as the sum of F(A,i,j)F(A,i,j)F(A, i, j) over all pairs (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) contained in SSS. We also define V(A)V(A)V(A) as the maximum value of beauty(S,A)beauty(S,A)\\texttt{beauty}(S, A) over all subsets SSS of PPP.You also have a machine that takes a copy of the initial array AAA as an input and performs KKK pre-defined operations on it in a fixed order. In each operation, it takes two indices, XiXiX_i and YiYiY_i, and swaps the elements present at those positions in the array at that moment in time. After that, it outputs the final array. You know what these operations are and the order in which they are performed.However, the machine is a bit lazy. It may skip some operations. But the order of operations does not change. In other words, it chooses a subsequence (possibly empty) of the operations and performs them in that order.Find the sum of V(P)V(P)V(P) over all possible outputs PPP of the machine (modulo 109+7109+710^9+7).In other words, consider the multiset RRR of the arrays we get as an output after the machine takes input as AAA and performs one of the subsequences (possibly empty) of the pre-defined operations. Note that there can be multiple occurrences of the same array in this multiset. Find the value \xe2\x88\x91P\xe2\x88\x88RV(P)\xe2\x88\x91P\xe2\x88\x88RV(P)\\sum\\limits_{P \\in R} V(P).Output the remainder of this value when divided by 109+7109+710^9+7.
