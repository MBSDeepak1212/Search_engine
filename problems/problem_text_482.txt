Chef has a random permutation P1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP1,P2,\xe2\x80\xa6,PNP_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N and an integer KKK.A subsequence (not necessarily contiguous) of this permutation is called good if it has at most KKK pairs of neighbouring elements such that the left element is larger than the right element.Chef wants to know the maximum length of a good subsequence of his permutation. Can you help him?
