Chef opened a chain of restaurants in Chefland and invited his KKK friends (numbered 111 through KKK) to move there.Chefland can be represented by a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN). For each valid iii, the iii-th vertex has a type cicic_i. There are K+1K+1K+1 types of vertices: ci=0ci=0c_i = 0 means that there is a restaurant in vertex iii, while 1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4ci\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le c_i \\le K means that there is a house with a colour cicic_i in vertex iii.For each valid iii, the iii-th friend of Chef agrees to move to Chefland only if he will live in a house of colour iii. Friends want to meet frequently, so Chef needs to choose houses for his friends in such a way that for each pair of friends, there is at least one restaurant on the unique simple path between their houses.Find the number of ways to choose houses for all friends. Formally, you have to find the number of sequences of vertices (v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vK)(v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vK)(v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_K) such that:for each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le i \\le K), cvi=icvi=ic_{v_i} = ifor each iii and jjj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4i<j\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\le i \\lt j \\le K), there is at least one vertex with type 000 on the path between viviv_i and vjvjv_jSince the number of these sequences could be large, compute it modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.
