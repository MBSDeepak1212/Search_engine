 Once, they went for a jungle adventure. There, the trio came to know about a mysterious Apple tree. The trio thought of eating apples from the tree. The tree was rooted at node 111 and consisted of total NNN nodes including node 111. Every node has an apple and a value associated with the node. The nodes are connected by edges having some weight www. The trio can move from any node vvv to node uuu and eat the apple at node uuu, only if node uuu is not node vvv and node uuu is in the subtree of node vvv and the path weight (from node vvv to node uuu) is less than or equals to the value associated at the destination node, i.e, value at node uuu.Thus, for each node v, the trio wants to know the number of vertices they can reach from node v and can eat the apples. Please help them.
