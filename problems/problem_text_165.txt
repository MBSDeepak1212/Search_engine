 The cell at the ithithi^{th} row from the top and jthjthj^{th} column from the left is a passable space if Si,jSi,jS_{i,j} is '.' and a blocked cell if Si,jSi,jS_{i,j} is '#'. Chef is at the top-left cell and wants to reach the bottom-right cell. Chef can move one cell down, or right to a passable cell. He can't leave the grid. If Chef is at the cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), he can collect Ai,jAi,jA_{i,j} coins. Now, Chef has a special ability using which he can make all the blocked cells in a path of length KKK into passable cells. Chef uses this ability before moving from the top-left cell. It is possible that some of the cells in the chosen KKK length path are already passable. More formally, Chef can choose a sequence of KKK cells such that for each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K)(1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K)(1 \\leq i \\lt K), the ithithi^{th} and (i+1)th(i+1)th(i+1)^{th} cells of the sequence are adjacent and make all these KKK cells passable.Find the maximum amount of coins Chef can collect in the path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell. Print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921-1 if it is impossible to reach the bottom-right cell.Note: Two cells are considered to be adjacent if they share a common side. The cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) has four adjacent cells i.e. the cells (i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i\xe2\x88\x921,j)(i - 1, j), (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i + 1, j), (i,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i, j - 1) and (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i, j + 1). It is guaranteed that the top-left cell of the grid is a passable cell.
