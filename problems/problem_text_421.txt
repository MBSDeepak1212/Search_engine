 He joined this company recently. To test his skills, his boss assigned him to help two of their customers: Aryan and Ali. Initially both of their phone numbers are empty (fantasy world you see). During each day , one of the following things can take place:Last digit of numbers of either Aryan or Ali can be erased.A new digit can be appended at the end of the numbers of either Aryan or Ali.The company also has a magical number MMM of length NNN, where each digit is between 000 and 999 (both inclusive). The positions of digits are numbered from 111 to NNN, from left to right. Aryan and Ali will be happy if both of their numbers appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MMM.More formally, suppose that Aryan chooses some positions from MMM such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be a1,a2,a3,...,apa1,a2,a3,...,apa_{1},a_{2},a_{3},...,a_{p} . Now , Ali chooses some positions, not already chosen by Aryan such that the digits at those positions form his current number (in the same order).Let the positions be b1,b2,b3,...,bqb1,b2,b3,...,bqb_{1},b_{2},b_{3},...,b_{q}. Then the following conditions should hold true :aiaia_{i} as well as bibib_{i} are strictly increasing sequences.For all pairs (ai,bj)(ai,bj)(a_{i},b_{j}) 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1 \\leq i \\leq p, 1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4q1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4q1 \\leq j \\leq q, ai\xe2\x89\xa0bjai\xe2\x89\xa0bja_{i} \eq b_{j}.Values of aiaia_{i}  are pairwise distinct. 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4p1 \\leq i \\leq p.Values of bibib_{i}  are pairwise distinct. 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4q1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4q1 \\leq i \\leq q.Ma1Ma2Ma3....MapMa1Ma2Ma3....MapM_{a_{1}}M_{a_{2}}M_{a_{3}}....M_{a_{p}} forms Aryan\'s number.Mb1Mb2Mb3....MbqMb1Mb2Mb3....MbqM_{b_{1}}M_{b_{2}}M_{b_{3}}....M_{b_{q}} forms Ali\'s number.Over a period of DDD days, Abhishek has to follow one of the following instructions each day:appendappendappend xxx yyy : You have to append digit yyy to the end of xxx\'s number.eraseeraseerase xxx : Erase the last digit from xxx\'s number. Abhishek has to help these customers over a period of DDD days. As he is a new employee, he asks for your help.For each of the DDD days, you have to tell whether the phone numbers of Aryan and Ali appear as non-overlapping subsequences of MMM.NOTE : Prefer using fast I/O methods, as the input is large.
