 Richie then showed him the room where he keeps his pocket money. There was a whole Mountain Range made of money inside the room. Mark could not believe his eyes. He asked Richie if he could take some of it. Richie said he could only take money from a Perfect Range of the mountain.Given the height of the mountain range at n consecutive points i.e. x1,x2,x3.....xnx1,x2,x3.....xnx_1 , x_2 , x_3 ..... x_n, (Where xixix_i denotes the height of the mountain range at x=ix=ix=i) and m queries consisting of two integers lll and rrr ( ll l, rrr define a segment in the array of heights ), find for each query, whether the given segment of the mountain range is a Perfect Range.A Perfect Range of mountains contains exactly one peak.A range consisting of a peak will look like ai<ai+1<ai+2.....<ax>ax+1>ax+2....>ajai<ai+1<ai+2.....<ax>ax+1>ax+2....>aja_i < a_{i+1} < a_{i+2} ..... < a_x > a_{x+1} > a_{x+2} .... > a_j . (i\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4ji\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4j i \\leq x \\leq j )  If Mark can take money from the segment given in a query, print YES. Else print NO.
