You are given a sequence of positive integers a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N. You may change up to two elements of this sequence, each of them to any positive integer (not necessarily the same for two elements). Let's denote the resulting sequence by b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bNb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bNb_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_N.Consider all 2N2N2^N subsequences of b1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bNb1,b2,\xe2\x80\xa6,bNb_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_N. For each subsequence, compute the sum of its elements (000 for the empty subsequence). Let's denote the set of these sums by SSS; note that a set contains each integer at most once. Finally, NOSS is the size of set SSS. For example, if [b1,b2,b3]=[17,23,40][b1,b2,b3]=[17,23,40][b_1, b_2, b_3] = [17, 23, 40], then S={0,17,23,40,57,63,80}S={0,17,23,40,57,63,80}S = \\{0, 17, 23, 40, 57, 63, 80\\} and NOSS is 777.Find the maximum possible NOSS.
