 You are given the x-coordinates of their left end-points: the i-th segment has the left end point at xi. You can see that the right end point will be at xi + R.You want to move the segments such that they lie entirely in the range [0, L]. After the movements, no two segments should overlap, however, they are allowed to touch each other.Find out the minimum number of segments that you need to move to achieve this. In other words, you want to maximize the number of segments that are left untouched. It's guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the segments is such that they all can fit in [0, L].
