 He always tries risky task. One fine day his friend told him that there is a treasure in an island called Trap of Death. After listening to his friend he immediately start his journey towards the island. He passed all the challenges before him. But the last stage is way more dangerous than he thought. In this stage there is a NNNxNNN matrix of tiles between treasure and Chef. He needs to step forward very carefully because one wrong step may cause death.If we consider NNNxNNN matrix, initially chef is at position (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) and treasure is kept at position (N,N)(N,N)(N,N) (rows and columns are numbered from 1 to N inclusive).  There are two instructions to pass the matrix of tiles.  1. Chef can only move down and right in the matrix of tiles. \t 2. All the tiles are either black or white. Chef can step only upon whitewhitewhite tiles. If he step upon blackblackblack tiles, he will die.For sake of convenience, white and black tiles are denoted by 000 and 111.  For example : 00101001010010003. There is number written on every tiles called weight of tiles. Chef needs to step in such a way that at the end of journey the sum of stepped weight of tiles is minimum possible.2193427852146863In the given example, the possible paths are  (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4)(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(3,4),(4,4)(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (3,4), (4,4) and (1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(4,4)(1,1),(1,2),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3),(4,3),(4,4)(1,1), (1,2), (2,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (4,4). Sum of weights in first path and second path are 202020 and 222222. Chef will have to follow the minimum weight sum path, in this case first path will give minimum weight sum.
