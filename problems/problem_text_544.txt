 Frustrated by it, he came up with an easier (maybe?) version of the problem.Given a rooted tree T (root = node 1) with N vertices (all containing value 0), Perform Q queries of the following type and output the final tree (nodes 1 to N).U X A B: The character \xe2\x80\x98U\xe2\x80\x99 followed by 3 integers X A BFor each query, let f be defined asf(1)=Af(2)=Bf(i)=f(i-1)+f(i-2)For every node on the path from root to X (both inclusive):T[i]=T[i]+f[level(i)]Where level of root node is 1.INPUT:First line contains two integers N Q denoting the number nodes and number of queries.Following N-1 contain 2 space separated integers U V denoting there is an undirected edge between U and VFollowing Q lines contain queries as specified.\xc2\xa0OUTPUT:After completion of all Queries, print N space separated integers denoting the value at each node (1 to N)\xc2\xa0CONSTRAINTS:1<= N,Q <=2*1051<= X <= N0 <= A,B <= 109\xc2\xa0SAMPLE TEST:\xc2\xa0INPUT:9 51 21 31 42 52 62 75 93 8U 9 1 3U 6 7 8U 1 2 3U 8 1 6U 9 2 4\xc2\xa0OUTPUT:13 15 6 0 10 15 0 7 17 EXPLAINATION:The tree is as follows:\xc2\xa0For the first query: X= 9A= 1B= 3The path from Root(1) to X(9) is 1,2,5,9  Add f(1)=1 to node 1Add f(2)=3 to node 2Add f(3)=1+3=4 to node 5Add f(4)=4+3=7 to node 9\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tree after 1st Query:1 3 0 0 4 0 0 0 7 Tree after 2nd Query:8 11 0 0 4 15 0 0 7Tree after 3rd Query:10 11 0 0 4 15 0 0 7Tree after 4th Query:11 11 6 0 4 15 0 7 7Tree after 5th Query:13 15 6 0 10 15 0 7 17Author:3\xe2\x98\x85mehul_dholiyaEditorial:https://discuss.codechef.com/problems/LOLTREETags:                                cfea2018, depth-first-search, dynamic-programming, medium, mehul_dholiya                                                                                  Difficulty Rating:                    N/ADate Added:7-02-2018Time Limit:1 secsSource Limit:50000 BytesLanguages:PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEMSubmit'
