 Yesterday there was a great party in the city - Chef\'s birthday. There were a lot of famous programmers at the party and, of course, everybody gave a gift to Chef. Andriy and Serhiy also didn\'t come empty-handed. Andriy gave Chef two integer numbers N and K. Serhiy was more inventive and gave Chef a strange function called "Random-Decreasing-Function", or "RDF" abbreviated. The function has the following form:RDF(N, K)    for i = 1 to K        do N = random(N)    return NIn above language function random(N) returns any integer in the range [0, N) with equal probability. Let\'s consider that random(0) = 0. Chef likes both gifts very much and he plays with them every day, let alone that he forgot about his restaurant. Chef runs this function plenty times a day. The only trouble is that results are too unexpected for Chef. Now he asks you to find the expected result of RDF(N, K).
