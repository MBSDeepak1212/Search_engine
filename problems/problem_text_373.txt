Chef\'s love for symmetry is well-known. This love is especially expressed for palindromic strings. Today, he has a triplet of strings, <A, B, C>, where each string is consisting of lowercase characters. He is interested in counting the number of ordered triplet of strings <S1, S2, S3> such that S1, S2, and S3 are non-empty substrings of A, B, and C, respectively, and S1 + S2 + S3 is a palindromic string, with \'+\' denoting the string concatenation operator.Note that 2 triplets are considered to be different if any substring chosen from a string in 1 triplet is different from the substring chosen from the same string in other triplet. You can check the definition of a substring here.Note:A string S is palindromic if it reads the same both forward as well as backward. To know more about palindromes, click here.
