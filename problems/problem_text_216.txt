You are a citizen of Arrayland. Your President (Mr. P) has given you a mundane problem:You're given an array a with size N (1-based indexing). You are allowed to perform an arbitrary number (including zero) of operations of the following type: choose an integer i (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N) and swap ai with aN-i+1.Your goal is to make the array a great. An array is great if it satisfies one of the following conditions:a1 > a2 < a3 > a4 < ... aNa1 < a2 > a3 < a4 > ... aNCompute the minimum number of operations necessary to make the array a great or determine that it's impossible to make it great.
