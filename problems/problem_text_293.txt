 There are N shops in the village fair. All the shops can be classified as a BadBadBad shop or a GoodGoodGood shop. Each shop has certain number of coins (AiAiA_i) assigned to it. If someone visits a Good shop, they will get AiAiA_i coins and if someone visits a Bad shop they will have to deposit AiAiA_i coins.  A Good shop will have positive AiAiA_i (including 0) and a Bad shop will have negative AiAiA_i.  Alice is playing a game. The rule of the game is simple. Alice has to move across ContiguousContiguousContiguous shops in the market lane, if she visits a Bad shop, she have to deposit the number of coins assigned to that shop and if she visits a Good shop, she gets the coins assigned to that shop, the only Restriction being that she can only visit contiguous shops. Formally, Alice can choose any i and j  such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i \\leq j \\leq N and visits all the shops between i and j (both inclusive). Initially Alice has 0 coins. Alice can also opt NotNotNot to visit any shop and ends up having 0 coins only. Alice wants to know the maximum coins she can collect. She alone cannot calculate this and asked for your help!. Are you able to tell the maximum number of coins Alice can collect if she plays optimally ?
