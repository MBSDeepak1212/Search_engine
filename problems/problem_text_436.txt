 In order to pass through this perilous stretch safely, Superman decides to task his disciples to disable the installations. A disciple can start his job from any point on the road, and continue disabling AS installations along the road by moving to each in turn. A disciple chosen for this task needs to be paid R amount for disabling at least one AS installation and additionally the square of the distance traveled as reward. Since Superman hasn't been able to work and earn much since the fighting started, he wants to know what is the minimum amount he needs to pay his chosen disciples to disable all the AS installations.
