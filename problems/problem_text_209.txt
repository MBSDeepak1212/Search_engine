 They have a rooted tree having NNN nodes (rooted at node 111), and the ithithi^{th} node has the value AiAiA_i associated with it (111-indexed). The value associated with the root node is 000.They start with a marker at the root node, and a score of 000. Alice and Bob moves alternatively, with Alice moving first. In one move, they can move the pointer from a node to one of its child node, and add the value associated with that child node to the score. If the marker reaches a leaf node, the game ends. Alice wants to minimize the score of the game, whereas Bob wants to maximize the score. They were about to start the game when the Charlie arrives. He looked at the game, and declared the game to be boring. However, Charlie asked them - "What will be the score at the end of the game, if eacheach\\textbf{each} one of you can skip at mostat most\\textbf{at most} KKK moves?"Can you help Alice and Bob to answer Charlie?
