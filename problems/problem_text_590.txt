 That's why he has to go there by bus every day after bunking the classes. The way from college to beach is represented by a segment of a straight line; the segment contains exactly N\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x891 bus stops. All of them are numbered with integers from 0 to N in the order in which they follow from RK's college. The bus stop by RK's college has number 0 and the bus stop by the beach has number N.There are M buses running between the college and the beach: the i-th bus goes from stop si to ti (si\xe2\x80\x89<\xe2\x80\x89ti), visiting all the intermediate stops in the order in which they follow on the segment. Besides, RK's no idiot and he wouldn't get off the bus until it is still possible to ride on it closer to the beach (obviously, getting off would be completely pointless). In other words, RK can get on the i-th bus on any stop numbered from si to ti\xe2\x80\x89-\xe2\x80\x891 inclusive, but he can get off the i-th bus only on the bus stop ti.RK can't walk between the bus stops and he also can't move in the direction from the college to the beach.RK wants to know how many ways he has to get from college to beach. Tell him this number. Two ways are considered different if RK crosses some segment between the stops on different buses. As the number of ways can be too much, find it modulo 109 + 7.
