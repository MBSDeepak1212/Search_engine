Your friend gives you n blocks one by one. You can either accept the block or reject it. You want to stack the blocks such that the blocks form a tall tower. While stacking the blocks you make sure to only accept the block if and only if the block is smaller than the block on top right now. A block is smaller if it fits inside the boundaries of the block currently on top (i.e. doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stick out)NOTE: You can always reject a block if you want NOTE: You always stack the blocks such that the height of the tower increases by 1 unit every timeYou need to find the maximum height of the tower possible if you already know the blocks which your friend is going to give you and in which order.
