Given a set S of first N non-negative integers i.e. S = {0, 1, 2, ..., N}. Find number of ways of choosing a K size subset of S with the property that the XOR-sum of all chosen integers has exactly B set bits in its binary representation (i.e. the bits that are equal to 1). Since the answer can be large, output it modulo (109 + 7). Please refer to notes section for formal definition of XOR-sum.
