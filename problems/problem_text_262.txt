Chef has a tree with N nodes. Each node of the tree has an integer weight associated with it.Let's define the cost of a sequence of numbers as the arithmetic mean of all elements of the sequence.Next, let's define the cost of a path in the tree as the cost of the sequence of weights of all nodes belonging to the path. (It's possible for a path to contain only one node.)A set of paths in the tree is called a correct path decomposition if each node of the tree belongs to exactly one of the paths from this set. The cost of a correct decomposition is defined as the minimum of costs of all paths in this decomposition.Chef would like to find the maximum cost of a correct decomposition. Can you help him?
