 Like all programmers, he is a coffee fan. He likes coffee so much that has K cups of coffee daily. However, having more than K cups doesn't suit him, because the excess caffeine won't allow him to sleep at night.Sergey's working day is divided into N periods. For every period, he knows how many kilobytes of code he can produce.During each of the periods, Sergey can either have or not to have one cup of coffee. If he is having a cup of coffee in some period, the amount of code he writes in this period drops to zero. But he also gets a productivity boost \xe2\x80\x94 if he decides to skip coffee during a period and the last cup of coffee he had was no more than D periods ago, the amount of code he writes during such a period is M times the usual.As his productivity advisor (congrats on your new job!), help Sergey plan his coffee breaks optimally. Please find the maximum number of lines of code he can write, provided that he has exactly K coffee breaks during the day.
