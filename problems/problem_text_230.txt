 On the way to Stipi, you decided to visit NNN planets (numbered from 111 to NNN) on the way to the destination (1st place being the source of your journey and Nth place being your destination). The spacecraft has a fuel tank of capacity 1L, so it needs regular refills. Every planet has a fuel station but the price of fuel is different over all the planets (AiAiA_i), also every planet is 1 km away from each other. There is a strange tradition on every petrol pump to get your fuel tank empty before getting it filled (The petrol pump will fill only 1 Litre, if the bike already contains some petrol, it needs to emptied). The spacecraft gives a mileage of KKK kmpL.Since you are very bad at planning trips but extremely proficient in writing code, you decided to write a program that could efficiently plan your trip. Since its end of the month and you have already spent your money on various things. So, the program should print the minimum cost of the trip i.e. the total money to be spent on fuel.Initially, the fuel tank is empty.INPUTFirst line contains two integers N and K.Second line contains N spaced integers- Ai denoting the cost of fuel in ith spacecraft.OUTPUTThe only line of output contains a single integer, denoting the minimum cost.CONSTRAINTS1<=N<=10000001<=K<=100001<=Ai<=1000SAMPLE INPUT5 31 2 3 4 5SAMPLE OUTPUT3Author:4\xe2\x98\x85tds115Editorial:https://discuss.codechef.com/problems/TRIPPYTags:                                dynamic-programming, heap, plin2020, tds115                                                                                  Difficulty Rating:                    N/ADate Added:6-01-2020Time Limit:1 secsSource Limit:50000 BytesLanguages:PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEMSubmit'
