It is the occasion of Annual Sports Day of ISM Dhanbad. Everybody has come to watch this spectacular event. The Event is going to start with a Marchpast. Since, the event has already been delayed by an hour, the students participating in the Marchpast line up randomly to save time.Now, the instructor got confused on how to arrange them properly in a short period of time. Therefore, he comes up with an idea that: He will remove the minimum number of students from the line such that he will end up with a line that has the students standing in monotonically increasing order according to their height.To solve this tedious task he asks you to come up with an optimal solution. Since there is no time for excuses.
