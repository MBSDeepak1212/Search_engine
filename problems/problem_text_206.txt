You are given an undirected graph with NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM edges. Each edge connects two distinct nodes. However, there may be multiple edges connecting the same pairs of nodes, and they are considered to be distinct edges. A lowercase English letter is written in each node.You are also given a string SSS with length LLL. A beautiful path is a sequence of L\xe2\x88\x921L\xe2\x88\x921L-1 edges such that there is a sequence of LLL nodes with the following properties:for each valid iii, the iii-th edge connects the iii-th and (i+1)(i+1)(i+1)-th of these nodesfor each valid iii, the iii-th character of SSS is written in the iii-th of these nodesThere are no other restrictions \xe2\x80\x94 a path may visit nodes or edges any number of times in any order.Determine the number of beautiful paths in the graph. Since the answer can be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.
