 Hence many            people want their car registration numbers to sum up to 9 on adding the digits recursively.        A car registration number can consist of 1,2,3 or 4 digits. Examples of some good car numbers are 63, 018, 9099, etc. whereas 12,129 are not            good.        Why is 9099 good?9+0+9+9 = 272+7 = 9 Similarly it is not difficult to see why 63, 018, 6669, 9999\xe2\x80\xa6 are good."        Given a string of digits, print how many subsequences of the string result in good car registration numbers.    Note:        The zeros at the starting of the number are to be accounted for, i.e. 018 and 18 are different numbers.
