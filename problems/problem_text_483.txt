Chef decided to order NNN lemons for a future Lemon Festival. The company "LemEx" that delivers lemons provides 3,0003,0003,000 yellow trucks and one red truck, and Chef wants to fully use them all. The trucks have identical capacities, so Chef wants each truck to transfer the same number of lemons.You are given a string MMM and an integer KKK. The decimal representation of the number NNN can be obtained by concatenating MMM with itself KKK times, e.g. if M=903M=903M = 903 and K=3K=3K = 3, it means that N=903903903N=903903903N = 903903903. You are not allowed to add any leading zeroes to this decimal representation, however, it may initially contain leading zeroes.It could be possible that NNN lemons cannot be delivered while satisfying the given rule. Therefore, Chef may change an arbitrary number of digits (possibly zero) in the decimal representation of NNN, i.e. choose a number of positions in this string and change each of the digits at these positions to a different digit. However, it is not allowed to change two or more digits with identical original values (at different positions). There are no restrictions on the resulting values of any digits; specifically, the resulting number is also allowed to contain leading zeroes.Find the number of ways to change the number NNN so that all lemons can be delivered by LemEx. Since this number can be very large, we ask you to compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
