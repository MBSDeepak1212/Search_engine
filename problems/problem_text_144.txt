 Eg. 120211202112021 is pallindrome while 212121 is not A number is called total-palindromic if it contains a palindrome with odd length greater than 111 and an even palindrome as a substring.For example, the number 226762267622676 is total-palindromic whereas the number 101101101 is not because it contains the palindrome of odd length 676676676 and even length 222222. While 101101101 does not contain an even palindrome as a substring.You are given two numbers aaa, bbb. Output the number of total-palindromic numbers which lie in the range (a,b](a,b](a,b] i.e set {a+1,a+2,....b}{a+1,a+2,....b}\\{ a+1, a+2, .... b\\}
