 This opened the gates to many unseen abilities and attacks and one of them was Akumaito-Kousen. They mastered this attack and learned to increase it's power to PP{P}. So now if there's an opponent with power less than or equal to PP{P}, he can be destroyed. Battle of Mirror-verse is a battle between NN{N} exactly same universes and our universe. Each universe has MM{M} warriors. Each warrior has a strength between 0\xe2\x88\x9290\xe2\x88\x929{0-9}.When the battle started, Vegeta and Goku transformed into Vegito. Seeing this warriors from other universes also decied to fuse into a giant monster. For fusion, a warrior from each universe must comes forward and contribute into the fusion. Every time a warrior fuses, his strength gets concatenated to the total strength(KK{K}) of the monster(i.e consider 333 mirror universe with 555 similar warrior with strengths = [1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5][1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Now a possible fussion can be 1st1st1st warrior from universe 111, 3rd3rd3rd warrior from universe 222 and 4th4th4th warrior from universe 333. The resultant strength will be 134134134). This fusion process comes with a cost, the final strength after the fusion becomes KK{K} % ZZ{Z}.Your taks is to calculate how many different giant monsters can our warriors defeat. Since the number can be very large, print is modulo 10000000071000000007{1000000007}.
