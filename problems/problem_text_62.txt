Last week Penguin Charlie had a birthday. Chef presented him a string S.Unfortunately, Charlie doesn\'t like string S, he likes string F. Charlie wants to create a few strings F from S by cutting. Cutting means getting some substrings from S that are equal to F and delete them from string S. After deleting a substring, the left and right parts of the resulting string remain separated. Note, a substring of a string S is a consecutive sequence of characters in S.In some cases Charlie can still get substrings equal to F from the pieces that remain after cutting the original string. Your task is to calculate the number of ways to cut out at least one occurrence of the substring F in S. As this number may be too large, print it modulo 109\xe2\x80\x89+\xe2\x80\x897.\xc2\xa0
