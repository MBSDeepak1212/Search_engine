 Initially, each point has a color, either red or green. You have to perform some number of operations (possibly 000) on this set of points such that all points are green after all operations.An operation is:Choose some line that does not pass through any of the points in SSS. This line should also not pass through the origin.The line divides the space into two half-planes. Let QQQ be the set of all points in SSS that are also in the same half-plane as the origin.Flip the colors of all the points in QQQ. That is, if a point in QQQ had the color red then it becomes green and vice versa.What is the minimum number of operations that need to be done to convert all the points to green color?It can be proven that it's always possible to convert any set of colored points to the green color in a finite number of operations.
