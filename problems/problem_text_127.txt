 DNA sequences are often matched to infer structural or functional similarities between living beings. Given two DNA sequences X and Y, the sequence Y is said to be contained in X if Y can be obtained from X by deleting 0 or more letters (not necessarily consecutive) in X. Given two DNA sequences X and Y, what can be the minimum length of a third sequence Z such that both X and Y are contained in Z?
