 He needs to reach his destination by crossing a N\xc3\x97MN\xc3\x97MN\\times M grid that contains at most one monster in each cell. His current location is at cell (1,1)(1,1)(1,1) and his destination lies in the cell (N,M)(N,M)(N,M). In every step, he is allowed to move 111 cell to the right or 111 cell downwards only.  Also, he cannot move outside the grid.The White Wolf has an initial health points of PPP points. Each time he fights with a monster, his health points decrease by XXX. If at any point in time, the total health points become less than or equal to 000, the White Wolf will immediately die and will never reach his destination.But that\'s not the end of the story. There are some special herbs placed in some cells throughout the grid (at most one in each cell). His health points will increase by YYY points if he uses a herb. It is guaranteed that there is no cell such that a monster and a herb will be at the same cell. It is also guaranteed that there are no herbs or monsters at the starting and destination cells.Your task is to determine the maximum possible health points the White Wolf can have when he reaches Kaer Morhen. Otherwise, determine that it\'s impossible to reach his destination.
