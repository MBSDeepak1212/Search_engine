.., an. Fluffy doesn't like to see larger number in front of smaller numbers. Thus, he wants to choose some of the integers from the array, and destroy them. Now, for each segment of the array that contains no destroyed elements, Fluffy wants the numbers to be non-decreasing, i.e. each element is at most equal to the one following it. For example, [3, 4, 4, 5] is non-decreasing but [4, 6, 5] isn't. He needs your help to find out how many ways are there to choose the set of integers to destroy (which may be empty or the entire set) such that all segments containing no destroyed elements are non-decreasing. Since the answer might be too large, he is just interested in the remainder of the answer when divided by 1000000007. (109 + 7)\xc2\xa0
