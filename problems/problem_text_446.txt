 She loves Chef Ciel very much.Since Tomya has completed collecting the stamps in Ciel's restaurant, she now challenges the bonus game in her restaurant.There are colored balls in a box.The number of colors is N, and the number of balls color i in the box is Si for i = 1, 2, ..., N initially.At first, Tomya has M coins.And Tomya's aim in this game is to get many coins at the end of the game.This game will run as follows.Tomya chooses a color, and Tomya bets some coins (suppose x coins are bet) on the color.Here x must be non-negative integer at most L, and Tomya must have x coins before betting.Then Ciel chooses a ball from the box, checks its color and discards the ball.If the ball has the same color as Tomya's bet, then Tomya gets B\xc2\xb7x coins, otherwise Tomya must pay x coins. Note that, if Tomya wins, then she receives back her bet as well as B\xc2\xb7x coins.While the box has at least one ball, the above process are repeated.When the box is empty, the game is over.The game is very kind, because Tomya always can increase her coins.Instead of this, Ciel is not kind in this game, she chooses the balls which minimize Tomya's coins at the end of the game (Yes, she can choose balls as she likes!).Your task is to calculate the maximum number of coins that can be obtained by Tomya at the end of the game.
