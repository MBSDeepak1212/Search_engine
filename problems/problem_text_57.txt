 The authorities always make an effort to find a match among the students\xe2\x80\x99 interests and the interests of the faculty members. First, they take a list of topics from the students' and a list of topics from the faculty. In order to avoid identifying students and faculties, all they preserve is simply, two consolidated lists of topics \xe2\x80\x93 one from the students and one from the faculties. No personal identification exists within these lists. The lists are sorted in ascending order of the indices of project topics in the repository. No topic appears twice in the same list.To make the process simple, ACME University maintains a repository of 100 project topics - numbered from 1 to 100, inclusive. The students and faculty members must choose among those topics only. Their lists may have different number of topics; since more than one student (or faculty) may choose to work work on the same topic or some may like to work on multiple topics etc.Once these two lists have been obtained, the university tries to make them identical. The student\xe2\x80\x99s list is modified to match with the faculty\xe2\x80\x99s list. The modification may be viainserting a new topic in the listdeleting a topic from the listsubstituting a topic by another oneThe university wants to do this with minimal number of modifications to the list as each modification needs one full day to be communicated and accepted by the students. It is assumed that the students do not disagree to any such modification.Write a program that accepts the lists from students and faculties and computes the minimum number of modifications that will require to be made to make the student's list identical to the faculty's list.
