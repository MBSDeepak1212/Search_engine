 Each road connects two different cities i and j and has a cost C(i,j) - this is the cost paid by the drivers which use this road (and, thus, it is Chef's profit). The road network has the following properties:it is possible to reach any city from any other city using the existing roadsany subset S of 10 or more cities contains at least two different cities A and B such that all the paths between A and B have at least one city X (X\xe2\x89\xa0A and X\xe2\x89\xa0B) in common (note that X does not necessarily belong to S) - note that this implies that if the city X were to be removed from the network, then no path would exist anymore between the cities A and BHowever, the anti-monopoly committee decided that Chef is making too much money and that some restrictions should be imposed. Chef will be allowed to keep a part P of the road network that he chooses, provided that:there exists exactly one path from any city in P to any other city in P using only the roads from P (this means that the sets of cities and roads from P form a tree)every city from P has at most 3 roads from P adjacent to itNote that P may consist of any subset of the N cities and any subset of roads connecting these cities, as long as the two restrictions are satisfied. However, Chef doesn't want to simply pick any part P of the road network which satisfies the restrictions. He would like to choose a part P for which the total cost of the roads which belong to P is maximum. Moreover, he would also like to know how many such parts P of maximum total cost exist. Two parts P1 and P2 are considered different if their subsets of cities are different or if their subsets of roads are different.
