 Vasu being one of the top coders in his college was given the responsibility to organize a coding contest for NIT Kurukshetra\xe2\x80\x99s tech festival. Although he was very good at solving questions, he found that it was a much harder task to make questions. The contest\xe2\x80\x99s date was coming close and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with any problems. Finally, Mr. Vasu decides to copy questions from a website to make the contest (not a decision he was very proud of).The website has NNN number of questions. Each of the questions has a difficulty rating associated with it. The ith question has a difficulty DiDiD_i. You are given a list of the difficulty rating of all the questions. Vasu has to select QQQ questions out of them (2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N2\xe2\x89\xa4Q\xe2\x89\xa4N2 \\leq Q \\leq N). He wants the minimum rating difference between any two questions out of all the questions that he selected should be maximized.
