There are NNN points in a plane (numbered 111 through NNN). For each valid iii, the coordinates of the iii-th point are (Xi,Yi)(Xi,Yi)(X_i,Y_i).We want to remove all the points one by one; you should choose the order in which they are removed.Whenever a point is removed, we compute the area of the convex hull of the remaining points. Then, we define a penalty PPP as twice the sum of all these areas. It can be proved that PPP is an integer.Let MMM be the penalty of an algorithm that always greedily chooses the point that minimises the area of the convex hull of the remaining points (if there is more than one such point, the point with the smallest XXX-coordinate is chosen; if there is still more than one point, then the point with the smallest YYY-coordinate is chosen). You are given this penalty. Your goal is to find a removal order that results in a smaller penalty.
