A pair of non-negative integers (A,B) is called and-pair if A & B = B, i.e., bitwise-and of A and B is equal to B. Similarly, a tuple of K non-negative integers (A1,A2,A3 .. AK) is called and-tuple if Ai & Ai+1 = Ai+1 for 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K-1.Given two integers N and K, how many and-tuples of size K exist such that the sum of the elements of the tuple is N?
