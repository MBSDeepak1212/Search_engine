Chef has been recently studying strings and probabilities and he came up with a problem for you.Consider an alphabet with NNN characters (denoted by c1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cNc1,c2,\xe2\x80\xa6,cNc_1, c_2, \\ldots, c_N). For each valid iii, the character cicic_i has a power aiaia_i; the power of a string that contains only characters from this alphabet is the sum of their powers (if a character occurs multiple times, its power also occurs in the sum multiple times). For example, the power of a string c1c2c3c1c2c3c_1c_2c_3 is a1+a2+a3a1+a2+a3a_1+a_2+a_3 and the power of a string c1c2c1c1c2c1c_1c_2c_1 is 2\xe2\x8b\x85a1+a22\xe2\x8b\x85a1+a22 \\cdot a_1 + a_2.Also, for each valid iii, you are given two parameters pipip_i and BiBiB_i, where pipip_i is a non-negative integer and Bi\xe2\x88\x88{0,1}Bi\xe2\x88\x88{0,1}B_i \\in \\{0,1\\}. For an integer KKK, we can construct a random string SSS with length KKK in the following way:Define R=\xe2\x88\x91i=1NpiR=\xe2\x88\x91i=1NpiR = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^N p_i.First, each of the KKK characters of SSS is chosen independently. For each valid iii and jjj, the iii-th character of SSS is cjcjc_j with probability pj/Rpj/Rp_j/R.Then, for each valid iii, we compute the number of occurrences of cicic_i in SSS and if the parity of this number of occurrences (i.e. its remainder modulo 222) is different from BiBiB_i, we discard the string SSS and try to construct a new random string SSS from the beginning.Otherwise (if the parities of occurrences of all characters match the sequence BBB), we have constructed the random string SSS.All parameters are chosen in such a way that there is at least one string we can generate without discarding it. In particular, R>0R>0R \\gt 0.What is the expected value of the power of the constructed string SSS? You need to answer QQQ queries. In each query, you are given a different value of KKK and you should find the expected power.For each query, it can be proved that the expected power can be represented as a fraction PQPQ\\frac{P}{Q}, where PPP and QQQ are non-negative integers and QQQ is coprime with 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353. You need to compute P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot Q^{-1} modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q\xe2\x88\x921Q^{-1} denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQQ modulo 998,244,353998,244,353998,244,353.
