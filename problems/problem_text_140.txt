As everybody knows, Reza Shiri is the favourite Iranian artist. Since we love Reza Shiri and his songs, we never download them for free. Reza Shiri\xe2\x80\x99s songs must be purchased from authorised stores. However, what if there is not enough money to buy all the songs?There are NNN songs (numbered 111 through NNN) and MMM albums (numbered 111 through MMM) available. For each valid iii, the iii-th song has greatness viviv_i, price pipip_i and belongs to the album aiaia_i. For each valid iii, the iii-th album has price bibib_i. If we buy an album, then all songs from this album count as bought. It is also possible to buy any songs individually.Your task is simple \xe2\x80\x95 given the budget PPP (the amount of money we have), calculate the maximum total greatness of songs we can buy. The total greatness is defined as the sum of greatness values of all distinct songs that are bought (either individually or as part of albums).
