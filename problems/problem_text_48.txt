Chef has a two-dimensional matrix A of dimensions N \xc3\x97 M, (N rows and M columns). He calls the matrix A beautiful if there exist an a\xc3\x97b submatrix, such that all of its elements are equal. In one minute Chef can increase one element of the matrix A by 1. Now he asks you to find out minimum time he will need to make the matrix A beautiful?Please note that sub-matrix of a matrix is a continuous rectangular block of the matrix. It can be denoted by two pair of indices (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) where x1 \xe2\x89\xa4 x2, y1 \xe2\x89\xa4 y2. The content of the submatrix will be all the cells (i, j) such that x1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 x2 and y1 \xe2\x89\xa4 j \xe2\x89\xa4 y2.
