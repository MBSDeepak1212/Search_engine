January and February are usually very cold in ChefLand. The temperature may reach -20 and even -30 degrees Celsius. Because of that, many people seal up windows in their houses.Sergey also lives in ChefLand. He wants to seal the window in his house. The window has the shape of a   simple convex polygon with N vertices.For the sealing, there are M kinds of sticky stripes, which are sold in the shops. The stripe of the ith type has the length of Li millimeters and the cost of Ci rubles.The sealing process consists in picking the stripe and sticking it on the border of the window. The stripe can't be cut (it is made of very lasting material) and can only be put straight, without foldings. It is not necessary to put the strip strictly on the window border, it can possibly extend outside the border side of window too (by any possible amount). The window is considered sealed up if every point on its' border is covered with at least one stripe.Now Sergey is curious about the stripes he needs to buy. He wonders about the cheapest cost, at which he can seal his window. Please help him.
