 Again. Buzz droids intend to disable rather than destroy their targets. They achieve this by introducing bugs in the program of the underlying software.One important module of every navigation controller is the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Here is how the code for Floyd-Warshall looks like:n <- number of vertices in the graphadj[n][n] <- adjacency matrix(0/1) of a simple undirected graphconnected[n][n] <- 2D matrix of size n * nfor (i=1; i<=n; i++)  for (j=1; j<=n; j++)    connected[i][j] = adj[i][j]for (p=1; p<=n; p++)    // runs only up to n-k after reprogramming  for (i=1; i<=n; i++)    for (j=1; j<=n; j++)      connected[i][j] = (connected[i][j]) \t\t\t|| (i!=j && connected[i][p] && connected[p][j])return connectedDue to reprogramming by Buzz droids, now the outer loop on p runs only from 1 to n-k (both inclusive).Your task is to find the number of simple undirected unweighted graphs for which the reprogrammed code still returns the correct answer. Two graphs are considered different if their adjacency matrices are not identical.
