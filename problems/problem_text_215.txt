You are given a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN) and a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. You may choose an arbitrary permutation p1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pNp1,p2,\xe2\x80\xa6,pNp_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_N of the integers 111 through NNN. For each valid iii, you should assign the value ApiApiA_{p_i} to vertex iii.Then, you should choose a vertex of the tree and K\xe2\x88\x921K\xe2\x88\x921K-1 times, perform one of the following operations:Move forward \xe2\x80\x94 move to a vertex which is adjacent to your current vertex. However, you must not move to the vertex in which you were immediately before the previus operation (if it exists).Turn around \xe2\x80\x94 stay in your current vertex. You may only do this if it is impossible to move forward. Since you do not move in this operation, you may move forward again afterwards.In this process, you obtain a sequence of vertices v1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vKv1,v2,\xe2\x80\xa6,vKv_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_K \xe2\x80\x94 the initial vertex and the vertices in which you were after each operation. Your score is \xe2\x88\x91Ki=1Apvi\xe2\x88\x91i=1KApvi\\sum_{i=1}^K A_{p_{v_i}}. What is the maximum possible value of this score?
