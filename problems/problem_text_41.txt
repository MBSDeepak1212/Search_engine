Let's consider a rectangular table R consisting of N rows and M columns. Rows are enumerated from 1  to N from top to bottom. Columns are enumerated from 1 to M from left to right. Each element of R is a non-negative integer. R is called steady if the sum of elements in the ith row is not less then the sum of elements in the (i-1)th row for each i where 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N and the sum of elements in the Nth row is less than or equal to M. Your task is to find the number of different steady tables of size N x M modulo 1 000 000 000.
