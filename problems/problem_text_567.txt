 But since they were too smart for any normal games, they made up a mind-boggling game for themselves. You have a board of size NNN x NNN. Every block on the board has 1 random piece on it and every piece has an assigned value. They have to perform the following steps and give the answer wisely.Firstly, they have to choose a square of size KKK x KKK (where 1<=KKK<=NNN) on the board such that (k\xe2\x88\x97p1)(k\xe2\x88\x97p1)(k*p_1) ^ (k\xe2\x88\x97p2)(k\xe2\x88\x97p2)(k*p_2) \xe2\x80\xa6. ^ (k\xe2\x88\x97pk)(k\xe2\x88\x97pk)(k*p_k) is maximum, where ^ denotes the bitwise XOR and pipip_i is the ith element of the south-east diagonal of the square (diagonal running from top left to bottom right of the matrix)If there are multiple such squares possible with the maximum XOR, choose the square having the maximum size, i.e., the number of elements present in the square.As a final task, the player has to give the total number of ways WWW possible to reach the ending point(bottom right) from the starting point(top left) in the chosen square without crossing the south-east diagonal (diagonal running from top left to bottom right of matrix), moving only in the right or downward direction.(The player can move only on the boundary of the chosen square. See the below diagram for more clarity.)The player has to give the maximum XOR and the number of such paths WWW as the answer.Since even WWW can be large, output WWW modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+710^9 + 7)
