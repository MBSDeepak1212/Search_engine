StatementChef gives you a book with N pages. The pages are numbered from 1 to N.Chef randomly selects a Secret Digit from 0 to 9. Now he asks you to open one page of the book without looking at the book. You win the game if that page number contains the Secret Digit. For example if the Secret Digit is 8, then 8, 80, 1238213, 98 are all winning pages and 9, 90, 1239123 are loosing pages.What is the probability of winning, if both Chef's choice and your choice has uniform distribution?
