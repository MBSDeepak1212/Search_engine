In the original Chef and Gordon Ramsay problem, Chef wanted to close all but three of this restaurants, and used his arch-rival Gordon's Secret Restaurant Placement Formula to decide which three to leave open to ensure their success.Chef is now seeking to expand his chain of restaurants to a new town and, would you know it, the dastardly Gordon has already set up his own chain of restaurants there! Once again, Chef conducts a little Industrial Espionage Market Research and discovers that Gordon's Secret Restaurant Placement Formula is different for this new town: the optimal way to arrange restaurants is still in triples, but this time, the restaurants in any optimal triple have to be equidistant from each other. Just like before, Chef is wondering about the number of ways to build an optimally successful triple of restaurants in this new town.More formally, the new town has NNN sites (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N - 1 bidirectional roads (the length of each road is 111 mile) in such a way that any site vvv can be reached from any other site uuu using these roads. For any pair of sites uuu and vvv, let dist(u,v)dist(u,v)\\textit{dist}(u, v) be the length, in miles, of the shortest sequence of roads that connects uuu and vvv.Some sites have been deemed suitable for building a restaurant; other sites are unsuitable. Help Chef find the number of ways to choose an ordered triple of sites (p,q,r)(p,q,r)(p, q, r) on which he could build his restaurants such that this arrangement of restaurants would be optimally successful, i.e.:ppp, qqq and rrr are pairwise distinct.ppp, qqq and rrr are all suitable sites.ppp, qqq and rrr are equidistant from one another, i.e. dist(p,q)=dist(q,r)=dist(r,p)dist(p,q)=dist(q,r)=dist(r,p)\\textit{dist}(p,q) = \\textit{dist}(q,r) = \\textit{dist}(r,p).
