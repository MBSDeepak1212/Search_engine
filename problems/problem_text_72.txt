There are NN buckets numbered 11 through NN. The buckets contain balls; each ball has a color between 11 and KK. Let's denote the number of balls with color jj that are initially in bucket ii by ai,ja_{i, j}.For each ii from 11 to N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 (in this order), someone draws a ball uniformly at random from bucket ii and puts it into bucket i+1i+1, then continues to draw the next ball. After putting a ball in bucket NN, this person draws a ball, again uniformly at random, from bucket NN.For each color from 11 to KK, find the probability that the ball drawn from bucket NN has this color.
