 A cell in this grid is represented as (i,j)(i,j)(i,j), i.e. the cell at the iii-th row and jjj-th column in the grid. You own two trucks AAA and BBB that deliver goods. Truck AAA is located at at (Ax,Ay)(Ax,Ay)(Ax, Ay) and Truck BBB is located at (Bx,By)(Bx,By)(Bx, By). Both trucks have an infinite number of goods. The two trucks could initially be at the same location.The distance to travel between cells (i1,j1)(i1,j1)(i_1, j_1) and (i2,j2)(i2,j2)(i_2, j_2) is the Manhattan Distance, i.e.,  |i1\xe2\x88\x92i2|+|j1\xe2\x88\x92j2||i1\xe2\x88\x92i2|+|j1\xe2\x88\x92j2||i_1-i_2| + |j_1-j_2| units.Your company has to serve NNN orders, where the iii-th order is located at position (xi,yi)(xi,yi)(x_i, y_i). An order is said to be served if some truck moves to the location of the iii-th order. Additionally, the iii-th order can be served only once all order numbers from 1 to i\xe2\x88\x921i\xe2\x88\x921i-1 have been served.What is the minimum total distance that the trucks must travel to serve all NNN orders?
