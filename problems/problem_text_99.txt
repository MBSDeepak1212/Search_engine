 Every number in the matrix is either zero or one. Calculate the number of such triples (i, j, h) where for all the pairs (x, y), where both x and y belong to [1; h] if y >= x, A[i+x-1][j+y-1] equals to one. Of course, the square (i, j, i+h-1, j+h-1) should be inside of this matrix. In other words, we're asking you to calculate the amount of square submatrices of a given matrix which have ones on and above their main diagonal.
