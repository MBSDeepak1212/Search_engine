 Yesterday, he learned how to use a stack to check is a given parentheses expression is balanced or not. He finds it intriguing, and more importantly, he was given an assignment. The professor gave him a string S containing characters \xe2\x80\x9c(\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c)\xe2\x80\x9d, and asked him numerous queries of the form (x, y), i.e., if the substring S[x, y] represents a balanced parentheses expression or not. Here, S[x, y] refers to the substring of S from index x to y (both inclusive), assuming 0-based indexing. Diligently working through his assignment, our ace student Churu finds that all the queries given by the professor represented balanced substrings. Later, Churu lost his original string but he has all the queries. Churu wants to restore his original string. As there can be many valid strings, print any one among them.
