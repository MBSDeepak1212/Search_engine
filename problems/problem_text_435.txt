 When the chef is stuck in any problem he asks for help from his friend Leonardo.                    Unfortunately, the chef is stuck in a problem and asks from his mathematician friend to calculate the sum from position LLL to RRR (Inclusive) of the special Fibonacci sequence.Special fibbonacci sequence (sf)(sf)(sf) is defined as 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,3\xe2\x80\xa6...0,1,1,2,3,5,8,3\xe2\x80\xa6...0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3\xe2\x80\xa6... i.e. the ithithi^{th} term of the series is the ithithi^{th} term of fibonacci sequence modulo 101010.Formarly, Leonardo has to calculate  v= \xe2\x88\x91i=LR sfiIf the given range is invalid, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921-1CONSTRAINTS.1<=T<=10^40<=L<=10^70<=R<=10^7INPUTFirst contains number of testcases T .Each testcases contains single line two space separated integer L and R.OUTPUTPrint a singe line value of v if possible else print -1.SAMPLE INPUT31 40 53 3SAMPLE OUTPUT7122EXPLANATIONf1%10 =1+ f2 %10=1+ f3%10 =2 + f4%10=3 is  7f0%10= 0+f1%10=1+ f2%10 =1+f3 %10=2+f4%10=3+f5%10=5 is 12f3%10=2 is 2Sum is possible if  R-L is Non-negative.Author:3\xe2\x98\x85abhishek__2007Editorial:https://discuss.codechef.com/problems/ENCJMAY5Tags:                                abhishek__2007, dynamic-programming, easy, encoding, enjm2020, fibonacci-numbers                                                                                  Difficulty Rating:                    N/ADate Added:4-05-2020Time Limit:1 secsSource Limit:50000 BytesLanguages:CPP17, PYTH 3.6, JAVA, C, CPP14, PYTH, PYP3, CS2, ADA, PYPY, TEXT, PAS fpc, NODEJS, RUBY, PHP, GO, HASK, TCL, kotlin, PERL, SCALA, LUA, BASH, JS, rust, LISP sbcl, PAS gpc, BF, CLOJ, R, D, CAML, swift, FORT, ASM, FS, WSPC, LISP clisp, SQL, SCM guile, PERL6, ERL, CLPS, PRLG, SQLQ, ICK, NICE, ICON, COB, SCM chicken, PIKE, SCM qobi, ST, NEMSubmit'
