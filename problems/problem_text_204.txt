 The Chef is a perfect example for this fact. He always tries to reduce the longest period of time of waiting for a bus. Therefore, optimizing the traveling plan for him is far from an easy task.Let's consider the bus system with N bus stations (numbered from 1 to N) and M buses (numbered from 1 to M). Each bus is represented by 4 integer numbers U, V, S, E which means it will start at the bus station U at the time S and arrive at the bus station V at the time E with no intermediate bus stations. If passenger arrives at the bus station U at the time X \xe2\x89\xa4 S, he has to wait for S \xe2\x88\x92 X units of time to catch this bus. Note, that if he arrives at the bus station U exactly at time S he can catch this bus with no waiting time.The Chef starts at the time 0 in the bus station 1, and he wants to arrive at the bus station N in a way that the longest period that he spends for waiting for a bus is as small as possible. Besides, he must be at the bus station N before or at the time T for a specially important meeting. Note, that he may wait for a meeting if he arrives at the bus station N early but that period is not our concern here, since he doesn't wait for any bus at that time.
