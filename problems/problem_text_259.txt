Pinako is worried about their obsession with Alchemy, and that they don't give attention to their studies.So to improve their mathematical solving ability, every day she gives a mathematical problem to solve. They can go out to practice Alchemy only after they have solved the problem.Help them by solving the given problem, so that they can go early today for their Alchemy practice.    Given an array AAA of NNN non-negative integers and two integers KKK and MMM. Find the number of subsequences of array AAA of length KKK which satisfies the following property:Suppose the subsequence is S=S1S2\xe2\x80\xa6SKS=S1S2\xe2\x80\xa6SKS = S_1S_2 \\ldots S_K, then for all iii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4K1 \\leq i \\leq K,Si%M=i%MSi%M=i%M S_i \\% M = i \\% M  should hold true, where SiSiS_i denotes the iii-th element of the subsequence, using 1-based indexing.As the number of subsequences may be very large, output the answer modulo 100000000710000000071000000007.     PS: We also proposed the idea of making a look-alike clone through alchemy and keeping it in front of the study table. But it seems impossible to convince Edward to make a clone of his exact same height, and not taller than him. So solving the problem for him was a better choice.
