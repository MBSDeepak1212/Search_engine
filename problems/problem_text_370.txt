 He gave her this problem.You are given an array A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN]A=[A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AN]A = [A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_N] containing NNN distinct integers. Count the number of ways to form (unordered) sets of disjoint increasing subsequences of AAA.Formally, count the number of sets S={S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Sk}S={S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,Sk}S = \\{S_1, S_2, \\dots, S_k\\} such that:Each SiSiS_i is an increasing subsequence of AAA.If i\xe2\x89\xa0ji\xe2\x89\xa0ji \eq j, SiSiS_i and SjSjS_j are disjoint, i.e, i\xe2\x89\xa0j\xe2\x9f\xb9Si\xe2\x88\xa9Sj=\xe2\x88\x85i\xe2\x89\xa0j\xe2\x9f\xb9Si\xe2\x88\xa9Sj=\xe2\x88\x85i\eq j \\implies S_i \\cap S_j = \\emptysetNote that it is not necessary that the sequences S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SkS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SkS_1, S_2, \\dots, S_k form a partition of AAA - in other words, some elements of AAA may not be in any chosen subsequence.Two sets are considered equal if they contain the same subsequences. For example, the sets {[1,2],[3]}{[1,2],[3]}\\{[1, 2], [3]\\} and {[3],[1,2]}{[3],[1,2]}\\{[3], [1, 2]\\} are considered to be the same and should only be counted once.Note that the final answer can be rather large, so compute its remainder after dividing it by 109+7109+710^9 + 7.Please refer to the sample for a few examples.
