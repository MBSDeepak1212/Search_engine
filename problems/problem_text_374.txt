 He knows that Chefina likes palindromic strings. Chef has a string SSS consisting of digits from 000 to 999. He wants to convert this to a palindrome by performing zero or more operations, where an operation is defined as follows:Pick any digit and replace all of its occurrences with any other digit.For example, if S=12123S=12123S = 12123, in one move it can be turned into 141431414314143 or 121281212812128, but not 321233212332123.You are also given NNN integers cost1,cost2,\xe2\x80\xa6,costNcost1,cost2,\xe2\x80\xa6,costN\\text{cost}_1, \\text{cost}_2, \\ldots, \\text{cost}_N, where the cost of performing an operation that replaces XXX characters is costXcostX\\text{cost}_X.Your task is to help Chef minimize the cost of converting his string to a palindrome.
