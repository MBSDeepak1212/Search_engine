The city is represented as a square grid of size NNN x NNN. Rows and columns of the grid are numbered from 111 to NNN. Each cell of the grid (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) has a tower of height Hi,jHi,jH_{i, j}. The height of each tower is between 111 and KKK (inclusive). It is guaranteed that there is at least one tower of each height in the city.The mayor's engineering team wants to use exactly K\xe2\x88\x921K\xe2\x88\x921K - 1 cables to create the network.The first cable should be between a tower of height 111 and a tower of height 222, the second cable should be between a tower of height 222 and a tower of height 333, and so on with the (K\xe2\x88\x921)th(K\xe2\x88\x921)th(K - 1)^{th} cable connecting a tower of height (K\xe2\x88\x921)(K\xe2\x88\x921)(K - 1) and a tower of height KKK, i.e., a chain of cables needs to be created in the height order 1,2,3,...,K1,2,3,...,K1, 2, 3, ... , K.The cost of connecting two cells (i1,j1)(i1,j1)(i_1, j_1) and (i2,j2)(i2,j2)(i_2, j_2) is |i2\xe2\x88\x92i1|+|j2\xe2\x88\x92j1||i2\xe2\x88\x92i1|+|j2\xe2\x88\x92j1||i_2 - i_1| + |j_2 - j_1|.For all iii such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K1\xe2\x89\xa4i<K1 \\leq i < K, the ithithi^{th} and (i+1)th(i+1)th(i+1)^{th} cables should have one tower in common.Find the minimum total cost of the chain of cables required to build the telephone network.
