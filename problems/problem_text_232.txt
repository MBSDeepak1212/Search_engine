Nadaca is a country with NNN cities. These cities are numbered 111 through NNN and connected by MMM bidirectional roads. Each city can be reached from every other city using these roads.Initially, Ryan is in city 111. At each of the following KKK seconds, he may move from his current city to an adjacent city (a city connected by a road to his current city) or stay at his current city. Ryan also has QQQ conditions (a1,b1),(a2,b2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aQ,bQ)(a1,b1),(a2,b2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(aQ,bQ)(a_1, b_1), (a_2, b_2), \\ldots, (a_Q, b_Q) meaning that during this KKK-second trip, for each valid iii, he wants to be in city aiaia_i after exactly bibib_i seconds.Since you are very good with directions, Ryan asked you to tell him how many different trips he could make while satisfying all conditions. Compute this number modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7. A trip is a sequence of Ryan's current cities after 1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,K1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,K1, 2, \\ldots, K seconds.
