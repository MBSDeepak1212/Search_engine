Abdullah has recently moved to Tolland. In Tolland, there are NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 bidirectional roads such that it is possible to visit any city from any other city. For each city iii, there is a toll value TLiTLiTL_i.Abdullah lives in city XXX. He has planned a tour of Tolland lasting for 2N2N2N days. For each iii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le i \\le N), on the 2i\xe2\x88\x9212i\xe2\x88\x9212i-1-th day, he travels from city XXX to city iii, and on the 2i2i2i-th day, he travels from city iii back to city XXX.In Tolland, there are also special discount coupons. For each city ccc and positive integer vvv, there is a discount coupon for city ccc with value vvv. All discount coupons may be bought anywhere in Tolland; the cost of each discount coupon is twice its value.When travelling from any city iii to any (not necessarily different) city jjj, Abdullah must pay a toll exactly once in each city on the path between them (including iii and jjj); even if he passed through some cities before, he must pay the toll in these cities as well. For any city iii, the toll is TLiTLiTL_i when not using any discount coupons; however, if Abdullah bought some discount coupons for city iii, he may use some or all of them to decrease this toll to max(0,TLi\xe2\x88\x92V)max(0,TLi\xe2\x88\x92V)\\mathrm{max}\\,(0, TL_i-V), where VVV is the sum of values of coupons for city iii used by Abdullah. Each coupon may be used at most once per day, but they do not expire when used and the same coupon may be used on multiple days. On each day, Abdullah may use any coupons he wants, but a coupon for city iii may only be used to decrease the toll in city iii.Abdullah has a travel budget: on each day, he must not spend more than KKK units of money on paying tolls. Before the start of the tour, he may choose to buy any number of discount coupons, for any cities and with any values (possibly different ones for different cities); the cost of coupons is not included in the budget for any day of the tour. Help Abdullah find the minimum total amount of money he must spend on discount coupons so that on each day during the tour, he will be able to stay within his budget by using the coupons he bought.
