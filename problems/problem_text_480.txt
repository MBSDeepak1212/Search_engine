 One day, they decided to play a game with two stacks of coins. There are n coins on each stack. A turn consists of choosing a nonempty stack and taking the coin on top of the stack. Note that one must take a coin each move. The game ends when all the coins have been taken.Fluffy moves first. Each coin has a value ci associated to it. When a player takes a coin with value x, his score increases by x. The value of the game is defined as Fluffy's score - Flippy's score. For example, if Fluffy has score 3 and Flippy has score 9, then the value of the game is 3 - 9 = -6. Determine the value of the game if both players play optimally.Note : Flippy and Fluffy has X-ray eyes. They can see the values on all the coins in the stack before the game starts.\xc2\xa0
