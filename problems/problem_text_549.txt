 He finds peace in donating gold coins to charities. He always liked the gold coins he had and used to number them with integers. One day he decided to donate NNN coins (coins numbered 111 to NNN) to CCC charities in the country. But Bill is a very moody person, some day he orders that each charity must receive at least one coin, sometimes he says at least two coins and some times at least three coins. But, every charity must receive coins. Bill\xe2\x80\x99s assistant Alice was once interested in the following question: In how many different ways can the NNN coins be distributed to the CCC charities, based on the order given by Bill? The charities can be assumed to be identical, i.e, ordering on the charities doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. But ordering on the coins matters as all coins are uniquely numbered. For example, even if we fix that one charity gets 111 coin and the other gets 222, then the possible different ways of distribution are {(1){(1)\\{(1), (2,3)}(2,3)}(2,3)\\}, {(2){(2)\\{(2), (1,3)}(1,3)}(1,3)\\} and {(3){(3)\\{(3),(1,2)}(1,2)}(1,2)\\}.Note: On a day, Bill either orders that each charity gets at least 111 coins, or at least 222 coins or at least 333 coins only. For a day, this value is fixed [111, 222 or 333]. Also, all coins are to be distributed.
