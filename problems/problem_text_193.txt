 They stand at the top of a huge staircase where the steps are numbered from n down to 1. In a single step, they can step down from stair n to stair n-1. Afraid of losing the challenge, flash bribes the judge and figures out a few tricks. If the stair number n is divisible by 2, he can jump directly to stair numbered n/2 in a single step. If the stair number n is divisble by 3, Flash can then jump directly to stair numbered n/3 in a single step. In order to win, one needs to reach the stair numbered 1, in minimum time. Assuming that both of them can take 1 step in 1 sec, calculate the minimum time required by Flash to reach the stair numbered 1.\xc2\xa0
