 He asks you QQQ queries. For each query, you are given the following:An integer XXX (0\xe2\x89\xa4X<220)(0\xe2\x89\xa4X<220)(0 \\leq X \\lt 2^{20}).An array BBB of size MMM such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4Bj\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4Bj\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq B_j\\leq N. You need to erase minimum number of elements from AAA such that the bitwise-OR of the remaining elements is at most XXX and no element having index BjBjB_j is erased.For each query, find the maximum number of remaining elements such that the bitwise OR of the remaining elements is at most XXX and no element with index BjBjB_j is erased. If it is impossible to get an OR of at most XXX, print \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921-1.Note: The bitwise OR of an empty array is considered 000.
