There is a straight road that passes through N short tunnels. At the entrance to the first tunnel, there are C cars lined up in a row waiting to enter the series of tunnels. The distance between each pair of consecutive tunnels is D metres (the lengths of each tunnel and each car are negligible) and the velocity of each car is S metres per second.Each tunnel contains a toll booth. In the i-th tunnel (1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N), processing a car at the toll booth takes Ai seconds. Only one car can be processed at the same time. If there are multiple cars in the tunnel, they all have to wait for the first car to be processed; afterwards, the first car exits the tunnel, the second car starts being processed and all remaining cars have to wait again, etc. Whenever a car arrives in a tunnel, it has to wait at that tunnel's toll booth until all previous cars have been processed and then get processed itself.The road and the tunnels are too narrow, so cars can't overtake each other at any time during the journey.Chef is after Reziba once again. Reziba's car is the first car to enter the tunnels, while Chef's car is the last car to enter the tunnels.Compute the final delay (in seconds) between the first (Reziba's) car and the last (Chef's) car immediately after Chef's car exits the last tunnel, i.e. after all the cars have passed through the tunnels. This delay is equal to the distance between the first and the last car divided by the cars' velocity, or equivalently to the difference between the times when the last car and the first car exit the last tunnel.
