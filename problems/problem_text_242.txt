 The nodes are numbered from 111 to NNN. The tree is rooted at the node 111. A tree is a connected undirected graph with N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N \xe2\x88\x92 1 edges.Find the sum of the distance between nodes xxx and yyy over all tuples (u,v,x,yu,v,x,yu, v, x, y) satisfying the following conditions:1)1)1) u<vu<vu \\lt v2)2)2) uuu is the ancestor of node xxx and vvv is the ancestor of node yyy.3)3)3) Neither of uuu or vvv is the ancestor of the other.Since the sum can be enormous, print it modulo (109+7)(109+7)(10^9 + 7).Note:The distance between two nodes of a tree is the number of edges in the shortest path between these two nodes.Node xxx is considered to be the ancestor of yyy if xxx lies on the path from 111 to yyy.Usually, there is no bound on the stack memory and is equal to the total memory limit of 1.5 GB. But due to a system configuration issue, the stack limit for C++ is temporarily set to 8 MB. So, if you believe that your code requires a larger stack limit, please include this in your code.
