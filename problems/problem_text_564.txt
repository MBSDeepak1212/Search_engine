 N Iron Blocks are dropped onto this field from the sky at particular coordinates. However, it is made sure that only one block is dropped at a particular coordinate. You are standing at a particular location (X, Y) of the field. You have a magnet with a power M in your hand. A magnet of power M at coordinates (x1, y1) can attract an iron block at (x2, y2) to its own location if max(abs(x1 - x2), abs(y1 - y2)) \xe2\x89\xa4 M. (abs represents the absolute value function)  Given queries containing your position (X,Y) and the value K. Your task is to find the minimum power of magnet you require to get at least K blocks to your own location. If it is not possible to get K blocks, output -1 for that case.
