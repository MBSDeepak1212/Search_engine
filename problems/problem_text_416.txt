Nazik gave Batman a tree with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN). There are some robbers in the tree; of course, Batman wants to catch the robbers.Initially, Batman is in a vertex sss and his power is equal to ppp. During each of the next MMM seconds, the following process happens:A robber with power rrr runs from a vertex xxx straight to vertex yyy.Batman either catches the robber or stays in his current vertex (and never catches this robber).Batman can only catch the robber if Batman's power is strictly greater than the robber's power.Let's denote Batman's current vertex by sss (s=sis=sis=s_i initially). To catch the robber, Batman must choose a vertex ggg such that each vertex on the simple path between xxx and yyy (inclusive) lies also on the simple path between sss and ggg (inclusive). If it is impossible to choose a vertex ggg so that this condition is satisfied, Batman cannot catch this robber.If Batman catches the robber, ggg becomes his current vertex.After Batman catches this robber, his power increases by ttt.Your task is to calculate the maximum power Batman can have after MMM seconds if he chooses the robbers to catch optimally.
