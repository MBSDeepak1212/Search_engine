There are NNN participants who take part in the race. The speed of each member iii is sisis_i.  The operation lambdalambdalambda didid_i of ithithi^{th} index is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum running speed among the first i members who ran the race.Formally, if sisis_i denotes the speed of the ithithi^{th} member who participated in the race, then di=max(s1,s2,...,si)\xe2\x88\x92min(s1,s2,...,si).di=max(s1,s2,...,si)\xe2\x88\x92min(s1,s2,...,si).d_i = max( s_1,s_2,...,s_i ) - min( s_1,s_2,...,s_i ).You task is to minimise the sum of lambdaslambdaslambdas d1+d2+...+dn.d1+d2+...+dn.d_1+d_2+...+d_n. To do this, you are allowed to change the order in which the members run. What is the minimum possible sum that can be achieved?
