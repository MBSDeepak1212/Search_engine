 This time, he got something really unique from the planet Gazorpazorp.The gift is a box on which are written NNN numbers, in the form of an array. On the back, there's a 'special number' KKK printed. Finally on the top, there's a digital lock attached. Rick tells Morty that the box can be opened, only when he enters the number of subsets of array whose multiplication of elements is divisible by KKK, modulo 109+7109+710^9+7, as the passcode.As Morty is busy with his birthday party, he hands over the box to you. Can you crack the passcode?
