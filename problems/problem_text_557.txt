 the sheet only includes only 1 type of Question but with Different data fields in each question.Question - Distance of top of bars from X-axis is given to you. Plot the Graph for given data   and find the Volume of Graph that can be filled with any fluid.You don't want to do the same calculation so many times since you're short on time. So you decide to write an algorithm that calculates the Volume of a graph. Note - Assume an elevetion Graph where width of each bar is 1. Now go write the Algorithm and help yourself.
