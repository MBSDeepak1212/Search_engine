In Chefland, there are NNN cities (numbered 111 through NNN) connected by N\xe2\x88\x921N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 bidirectional roads in such a way that it is possible to reach any city from any other city. Each city has its own traditional dish for which it is famous; let's denote the tastiness of the dish in city iii by AiAiA_i.Chef is currently learning how to prepare tastier dishes. At any point, he can only remember how to cook one dish. Initially, the tastiness of the dish he can cook is WWW. Chef is going to travel from city 111 to city vvv. In each city he visits (including 111 and vvv), if the tastiness of the traditional dish of this city is strictly greater than the tastiness of the dish he can currently cook, then he forgets the dish he can currently cook and learns the traditional dish of this city.Now, Chef is wondering how many times he is going to learn a new dish during his trip. You should answer QQQ independent queries. In each query, you are given the initial tastiness WWW and Chef's final destination vvv; compute the number of times Chef learns a new dish. Note that the input is given in a special format, so you have to answer the queries online.
