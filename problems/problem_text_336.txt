Chef has n distinct points in 2-D plane, i.e. there are never two points with both x and y coordinate equal and there are no two points with same x coordinate. Consider a subset of above n points which can be arranged as a sequence p1,..pk, such that xp1< xp2 < ...< xpk and each point pi, where i is in range between 3 and k (both inclusive) lies below or on the line passing between points pi-1 and pi-2. Chef likes these kind of subsets. So he wants to find the size of largest of such subsets.
