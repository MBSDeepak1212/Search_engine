 His tree contains N vertices and N-1 edges. Each vertex has some integer score associated with it. During his experiment, Torque can delete any edge from tree. This results in two connected components. Now, he will discard one component and keep the other component with him. He may perform his experiment any number of times (possibly none, at most N-1 times). In the end total score is the sum of scores of all nodes present in the tree left with Torque. Your task is to tell the maximum possible score.
