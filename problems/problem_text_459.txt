Energy Sequence is known as [x,x\xe2\x88\x97e,x\xe2\x88\x97e2,x\xe2\x88\x97e3,......,x\xe2\x88\x97ek][x,x\xe2\x88\x97e,x\xe2\x88\x97e2,x\xe2\x88\x97e3,......,x\xe2\x88\x97ek][x,x*e,x*e^2,x*e^3,......,x*e^k] for any value xxx and kkk, where e=energye=energye=energyPeely gives Jonesy a Sequence and Energy, Jonesy's task is to find the longest energy sub-sequence of the given Sequence.As Always Jonesy is busy, He asks your help to complete the task.  sub-sequence of an array can be obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.You can erase any elements, not necessarily going successively. The remaining elements preserve their order.For example, for the array [1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5] the following arrays are sub-sequences: [1][1][1], [1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5][1,2,3,4,5], [2,3,5][2,3,5][2,3,5], but the array [4,1][4,1][4,1] is not.
