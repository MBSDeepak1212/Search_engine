 There are some weights on each edge of the tree denoted by WiWiW_i. The tree root is a vertex with number 111. In this problem, you need to answer QQQ queries. Each query is described by three values uuu, vvv, and xxx. It is guaranteed that subtrees of node uuu and node vvv are disjoint. You are allowed to add at most one edge of weight xxx between any node in the subtree of uuu and any node in the subtree of vvv. Find the maximummaximummaximum weighted path between uuu and vvv given that each node can occur only once in a path.A subtree of some vertex is a subgraph containing that vertex and all its descendants.
