Mathison and Chef are playing a new teleportation game. This game is played on a R\xc3\x97CR\xc3\x97CR \\times C board where each cell (i,j)(i,j)(i, j) contains some value Vi,jVi,jV_{i, j}. The purpose of this game is to collect a number of values by teleporting from one cell to another. A teleportation can be performed using a tel-pair.A player is given NNN tel-pairs. Each tel-pair can be used at most once and a player can use them in any order they like. Suppose a player is at cell (a,b)(a,b)(a, b) and the tel-pair is (dx,dy)(dx,dy)(dx, dy). Then, the player can reach in one teleportation any cell (c,d)(c,d)(c, d) from (a,b)(a,b)(a, b) such that |a\xe2\x88\x92c|=dx|a\xe2\x88\x92c|=dx|a \xe2\x88\x92 c| = dx and |b\xe2\x88\x92d|=dy|b\xe2\x88\x92d|=dy|b \xe2\x88\x92 d| = dy.It is Mathison\xe2\x80\x99s turn next in the game to make a sequence of moves. He would like to know what is the highest value of a path of length at most N+1N+1N+1 that starts in (Sx,Sy)(Sx,Sy)(Sx, Sy) and uses some (possibly none) of the tel-pairs given. The length of a path is equal to the number of cells in the path. The value of a path is equal to the sum of Vi,jVi,jV_{i, j} over all cells in the path.
