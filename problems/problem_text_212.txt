 Today, we have one such problem for you!You're given an array A with N integers, A1, A2, A3....AN. You have to partition the elements of array A into exactly K disjoint subsets such that the following conditions are satisfied:Size of each subset must be at least 2.Let the K subsets be S1, S2.... SK. Let Di = max(Si) - min(Si) where max(Si) is maximum element in Si and min(Si) is the minimum element in Si. We want to minimize value of D1 + D2 + D3 + .... + DK.Find the minimum possible sum of D1 + D2 + D3 + .... + DK that you can obtain.
