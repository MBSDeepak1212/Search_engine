Chef Shahhoud wants to hire new chefs for his restaurant. Shahhoud posted a job offer on Chef Rami\'s paper "Fast Food Times".NNN candidates (numbered 111 through NNN) have applied for the job. There are MMM traits that define how good a chef is. You are given NNN strings S1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS1,S2,\xe2\x80\xa6,SNS_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_N describing the traits of the candidates. Each of these strings has length MMM. For each valid iii and jjj, the jjj-th character of SiSiS_i is \'1\' if the iii-th chef has the jjj-th trait or \'0\' if this chef does not have this trait.Shahhoud wants to choose a non-empty subsequence HHH (not necessarily contiguous) of the sequence (1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N)(1,2,\xe2\x80\xa6,N)(1, 2, \\ldots, N) and hire all candidates from HHH. However, the sequence HHH must satisfy an additional condition: for any two consecutive elements of HHH (let\'s denote them by xxx and yyy), candidates xxx and yyy have no common traits, to prevent fights between them.Now, Shahhoud is wondering: how many such valid subsequences exist? Find this number modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+7109+710^9 + 7).
