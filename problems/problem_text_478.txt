Chef Ada constructed a simple undirected graph GGG with NNN vertices (numbered 111 through NNN) as follows:Start with a complete graph with KKK vertices and K\xe2\x8b\x85(K\xe2\x88\x921)/2K\xe2\x8b\x85(K\xe2\x88\x921)/2K \\cdot (K-1)/2 edges.Then, add N\xe2\x88\x92KN\xe2\x88\x92KN-K vertices one by one. After adding each vetex, find some clique of K\xe2\x88\x921K\xe2\x88\x921K-1 vertices in the graph and connect the new vertex to all the vertices of that clique.Consider NNN boolean variables X1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XNX1,X2,\xe2\x80\xa6,XNX_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_N and their negations \xc2\xacX1,\xc2\xacX2,\xe2\x80\xa6,\xc2\xacXN\xc2\xacX1,\xc2\xacX2,\xe2\x80\xa6,\xc2\xacXN\eg X_1, \eg X_2, \\ldots, \eg X_N, corresponding to vertices of the graph. You are given the initial values of all variables.A CNF boolean expression is defined as a conjunction of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction of two or more elements of the set of variables and their negations.Using the graph GGG, Ada wrote a CNF boolean expression BBB with MMM clauses, where each clause corresponds to a clique in the graph with some (maybe none) of the variables (corresponding to vertices) negated. More formally, for each iii from 111 to MMM:Ada chose some clique in the graph, consisting of LiLiL_i vertices Z1,Z2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ZLiZ1,Z2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ZLiZ_1, Z_2, \\ldots, Z_{L_i}then for each valid jjj, Ada chose a variable Pi,jPi,jP_{i,j} as either XZjXZjX_{Z_j} or \xc2\xacXZj\xc2\xacXZj\eg X_{Z_j}the iii-th clause in the expression BBB had LiLiL_i terms: Pi,1\xe2\x88\xa8Pi,2\xe2\x88\xa8\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x88\xa8Pi,LiPi,1\xe2\x88\xa8Pi,2\xe2\x88\xa8\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x88\xa8Pi,LiP_{i,1} \\lor P_{i,2} \\lor \\ldots \\lor P_{i,L_i}Ada wants the expression to evaluate to "true". In order to achieve that, she may change the values of variables; for each valid iii, the cost of changing the value of XiXiX_i (from "true" to "false" or vice versa) is CiCiC_i. Find the minimum total cost needed to make the expression BBB evaluate to "true" or determine that it is impossible.
