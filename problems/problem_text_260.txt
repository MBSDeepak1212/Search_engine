 The vertices are numbered from 111 to NNN. Some of the vertices are colored black and some are colored red. Also, some vertices can be uncolored. There is at least one black and at least one red vertex.Compute the number of subsets of vertices WWW such that:Each vertex in WWW is uncolored.WWW is a connected subgraph of the tree.If you remove all the vertices of set WWW, there will be at least one pair of vertices (u,v)(u,v)(u, v) such that uuu is black and vvv is red, and there is no path from uuu to vvv.Output your answer modulo 109+7109+710^{9} + 7.
