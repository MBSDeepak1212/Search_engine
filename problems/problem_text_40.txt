Given an array A1,A2...AN, you have to print the size of the largest contiguous subarray such that LCM of all integers in that subarray is equal to the product of all integers in that subarray.Formally, For a subarray Ai,Ai+1...Aj where 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i < j \xe2\x89\xa4 N to be valid: LCM(Ai,Ai+1...Aj) should be equal to Ai*Ai+1*...*Aj. You have to print the size of the largest valid subarray.If no subarray satisfies output -1.Note:A single element is not considered a subarray according to definition in this problem.
