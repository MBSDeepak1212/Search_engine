 In an election, all voters stand in a queue and vote one by one. Voter at position iii in the queue votes at the beginning of iii-th minute. After the results were declared, Alice got AAA votes and Bob got BBB votes. Thus, the voting happens for A+BA+BA+B minutes. Chef, being an statistician, decided to play with election results. He wants to calculate the duration for which Alice was ahead of Bob at the time of voting, but he does not remember the initial arrangement of voters in queue. Help him to calculate the expected value of the duration, in minutes, if the voters are arranged randomly, that is, every arrangement is equally likely. If the answer is P/QP/QP/Q where P,QP,QP,Q are co-prime integers and Q\xe2\x89\xa00Q\xe2\x89\xa00Q\e 0, output RRR such that 0\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4109+60\xe2\x89\xa4R\xe2\x89\xa4109+60\\le R\\le 10^9+6 and R\xc3\x97Q\xe2\x89\xa1Pmod(109+7)R\xc3\x97Q\xe2\x89\xa1Pmod(109+7)R\\times Q\\equiv P \\mod (10^9+7).
