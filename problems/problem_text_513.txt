 The only difference is in the constraints.sibasish_14 is going to retire from problemsetting for IIIT-Bh's Competitive  Coding Club(C3)(C3)(C^3) after Fastest Code First 2.0. So, now it's upto pritishn to choose a replacement for him. The viable options are niket_301 and cryptobrat.   However, cryptobrat is busy making projects for his CV/Resume and niket_301 is busy playing Skyrim. So both of them are hesitant to do problemsetting voluntarily.So, pritishn has decided to do the following to choose the next problem setter:Take a N\xc3\x97NN\xc3\x97NN \\times N matrix (rows numbered from 1 to N top to bottom and columns numbered from 1 to N left to right). Each cell of the matrix has one of the three characters 'D', 'L' and 'R'.Now he will put a robot on any of the cells  (randomly chosen) in the first row and the robot will move according to the character written on the cell it's standing on.For each cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) :if the character is 'D' , the robot will move to cell (i+1,j)(i+1,j)(i+1,j) from this cell.if the character is 'L' , the robot will move to cell (i,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i,j\xe2\x88\x921)(i,j-1) from this cell.if the character is 'R' , the robot will move to cell (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i,j+1) from this cell.  The robot will not move out of the matrix. If a cell has a character that tells robot to move out of the cell , then the robot will stop there.It's guaranteed that there's no cell (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) such that this cell has 'R' and cell (i,j+1)(i,j+1)(i,j+1) has 'L' .Let the cell that the robot stops at be (i,j)(i,j)(i,j) . If i+ji+ji+j is an even number, then niket_301 will be chosen otherwise cryptobrat will be chosen.You are given the matrix , print out the number of cells in the first row that will lead to choosing niket_301.
