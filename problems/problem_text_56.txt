Little Elephant from Zoo of Lviv likes to paint.He has n objects to paint, ordered in a row and numbered form left to right starting from 1. There are totally c colors, numbered from 0 to c-1. At the beggining all objects are colored in color with number 1. When object with color a is painted in color b, the resulting color will have number (a*b) mod c.Little Elephant is going to make k turns. At i-th (0-based numeration) turn he will randomly choose any subset (even empty) of objects with indices in range [Li; Ri] (inclusive) and paint all objects in chosen subset with random color (the same for all objects in the subset).Little Elephant wants to know the expected sum of all colors over all n objects after making all k turns. Help him.
