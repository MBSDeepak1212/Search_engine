 He was just about to put them in the hot oil tawa when he remembered that the crispy edges of samosa taste particularly delicious.Since our Samosa wala bhaiya is also a lover of Geometry so, he thinks he would be happiest if the sum of the perimeters of all the samosa were as close as possible to PPP centimetres(cm), without going over. (If the batch of Samosa is too edgy, it might burn!)For each Samosa, Samosa wala Bhaiya can decide whether to leave it as is, or make a single straight cut to separate it into two (not necessarily rectangular) halves with equal area. (Note that such a cut must necessarily go through the center of the Samosa.) The two new Samosa created in this way cannot themselves be cut again.If Samosa wala bhaiya makes optimal decisions, what is the closest he can come to PPP without exceeding it?
