 The aliens have placed mines in the battlefield, where the battlefield can be described as grid ofsize n\xe2\x88\x97mn\xe2\x88\x97mn*m, where nnn denotes the number of rows numbered from 111 to nnn from top to bottom and mmm denotes the number of columns numbered from 111 to mmm from left to right.However, the human army knows the positions of the mines denoted by (xxx,yyy) in the fieldand you being the commander have been assigned a task.The task is described as follows:Given the number of mines xxx (1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x97m)(1\xe2\x89\xa4x\xe2\x89\xa4n\xe2\x88\x97m)(1 \\leq x \\leq n*m) and their respective positions in the grid consistingof binary values 000 or 111, where a value of 111 in cell ( iii , jjj ) ( 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4n,1\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4m1 \\leq i \\leq n , 1 \\leq j \\leq m ) denotes the presence of mine at position (iii,jjj) and a value of 000 in cell (iii,jjj) denotes that the cell is free.Since the mines are quite heavy, the operation of relocating a mine is described as moving a mine to either of its neighbouring side cells or leaving the mine in its current position only, but you can only perform this operation once for every ithithith mine 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4x1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4x1 \\leq i \\leq x, in other words you can move a mine from it's current position denoted by ( xi,yixi,yix_{i},y_{i} ) to either of the 555 positions - ( xi\xe2\x88\x921,yixi\xe2\x88\x921,yix_{i}-1,y_{i} ), ( xi+1,yixi+1,yix_{i}+1,y_{i} ) , ( xi,yi\xe2\x88\x921xi,yi\xe2\x88\x921x_{i},y_{i}-1 ), ( xi,yi+1xi,yi+1x_{i},y_{i}+1 ), ( xi,yixi,yix_{i},y_{i} ), such that the new position of the mine remains inside the field. A cell can contain multiple mines after relocation.So, you need to relocate the mines in such a way that maximum number of cells get free in the battlefield, incurring minimum damage.NOTE: The operation of relocating a mine from it's current position to either of the 555 positions such  that the new position of the mine remains inside the field can only be performed once for every  mine.
