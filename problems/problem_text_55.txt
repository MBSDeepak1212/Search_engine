Chef has a sequence of integers A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. He takes a sheet of paper and for each non-empty subsequence BB of this sequence, he does the following:For each integer which appears in BB, count its number of occurrences in the sequence BB.Choose the integer with the largest number of occurrences. If there are several options, choose the smallest one.Finally, write down the chosen integer (an element of BB) on the sheet of paper.For each integer between 11 and NN inclusive, find out how many times it appears on Chef's sheet of paper. Since these numbers may be very large, compute them modulo 1,000,000,0071,000,000,007 (109+710^9 + 7).
