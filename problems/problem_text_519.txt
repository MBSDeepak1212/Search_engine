 Each node of the tree is assigned a distinct value.A path in the tree is considered weird if the values in the path increase and decrease alternatively.For example: Consider a straight chain of nodes 1\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x924\xe2\x86\x925 with value assigned to any node i being i itself. Then the path 3\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x924, 1\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x922, etc. are weird whereas 1\xe2\x86\x923\xe2\x86\x922\xe2\x86\x924\xe2\x86\x925 is not weird because 2\xe2\x86\x924 and 4\xe2\x86\x925 are both increasing.You are given Q queries. Each query contains the root of the tree, R, and an arbitrary node, S. For each query, you need to find the sum of all weird paths in the subtree rooted at S with respect to R being the root of the original tree. Sum of a path is defined as the sum of values assigned to all nodes on that path. As this sum could be very large, output it modulo M.Note:Paths of length 2 are always considered weird.A path is always defined for more than 1 node.
