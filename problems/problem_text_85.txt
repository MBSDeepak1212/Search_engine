 There are NNN houses in the city. The resident of the ithi^{th} house is of type AiA_i. It is known that people of the same type are friends and people of different types are not friends. To maintain peace, Batman can do the following type of operation:Choose indices ii and jj (1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4j\xe2\x89\xa4N)(1\\leq i \\le j \\le N) and reverse the substring A[i,j]A[i,j]. Determine the length of the longest range of friends after applying at most kk operations on the string for all 0\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa4N0 \\le k \\le N.
