 Therefore, we do not live in a society --Last paragraphs of the IZhO 2022 EditorialK0Kalaru47 was out with his friends and he started to tell them about a CP Task. Because the statement was informal, his friends quickly parried with "Who Asked", so here is the formal statement:Given arrays PPP and CCC of size (N+K)(N+K)(N+K) each, the beauty of an array BBB of size (N+K)(N+K)(N+K) is defined as the sum of CiCiC_i for all 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4(N+K)1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4(N+K)1\\leq i \\leq (N+K) such that Bi=PiBi=PiB_i = P_i.More formally, the beauty of an array BBB is equal to \xe2\x88\x91|B|i=1Ci\xe2\x88\x91i=1|B|Ci\\large\\sum^{|B|}_{i=1} C_i [Bi=Pi][Bi=Pi][B_i = P_i] Given an array AAA of size NNN such that (1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4M)(1\xe2\x89\xa4Ai\xe2\x89\xa4M)(1 \\leq A_i \\leq M). Your task is to insert KKK elements into the array such that:Each inserted element lies in the range [1,M][1,M][1, M].The beauty of the final array is maximized.Note that, an element can be inserted at any index of the array.You should find two values: The maximum beauty that can be obtained across all arrays of size (N+K)(N+K)(N+K).The number of distinct arrays of size (N+K)(N+K)(N+K) having the maximum beauty. Note that, two arrays XXX and YYY are said to be different if there exists some index iii such that Xi\xe2\x89\xa0YiXi\xe2\x89\xa0YiX_i \xe2\x89\xa0 Y_i. Since the number of distinct arrays can be huge, print the value modulo MODMODMOD.
