You are given a positive integer kkk and an array aaa consisting of nnn integers. You will partition the array into kkk non-empty segments such that each number belongs to exactly one segment. Let's denote sisis_i as the sum of all numbers belonging to iii-th segment after partitioning. Your goal is to maximize the value of min(s1,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk)min(s1,\xe2\x80\xa6,sk)min(s_1, \\ldots, s_k). Calculate and print this value.
