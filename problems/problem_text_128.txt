Nikki has NNN coconuts, she wants to prepare a special coconut soup for her best friend Mansi. In order to make this soup, she has to break ZZZ coconuts. For each coconut, there is a fixed number of times Nikki needs to hit it if she wants it to break. Nikki can only hit one coconut at the same time.Their friend Sakshi is a troublemaker. This time, Sakshi shuffled the coconuts in some (unknown) way. You are given a sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N with the following meaning: it is possible to label the coconuts 111 through NNN in such a way that for each valid iii, the iii-th coconut needs to be hit exactly AiAiA_i times to break.Nikki wants to prepare the soup as soon as possible, so she wants to minimise the number of times she has to hit coconuts in the worst case in order to break ZZZ coconuts. Formally, she wants to find a strategy of hitting coconuts, possibly depending on which coconuts broke after which hits, such that no matter which coconuts broke and when, it is guaranteed that after HHH hits, there will be ZZZ broken coconuts, and there is no strategy with smaller HHH. Help Nikki find HHH \xe2\x80\x94 the minimum required number of hits.
