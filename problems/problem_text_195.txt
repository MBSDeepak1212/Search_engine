 Onthe way to your home, you found Ambani brothers donating all their wealth in form of coinsafter getting fed up with all the money they have. The coins have both positive and negativevalues and they are laid down in a line. Now as you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go with an empty sack soyou also decided to take some of the money being given by Ambani\xe2\x80\x99s. But anyone whowants the money has to follow a rule that he/she can choose an only contiguous segment ofcoins which are lying in a line (you can also imagine it like an array of coins) whether its valueis positive or negative.Formally according to the rule if you are given an array [-1,2,3,4,2,0] you can only choosesubarrays like [2,3], [4,2,0], [-1] , [-1,2,3,4,2,0] etc.Now as you have two siblings you decided to fill both the sacks with some coins. Your task isto choose the coins in such a way that the sum of values of all the coins(including sacks 1and 2) is maximum and both sacks are non-empty.For e.g.:If the array of coins is:-1 2 3 4 -3 -5 6 7 1Following are some ways you can choose the coins:2 3 4 and -5 6 7-1 2 3 and 6 7 12 3 4 and 6 7 1and so on\xe2\x80\xa6.You can see that among the given ways the 3rd way will yield maximum values (2+3+4) +(6+7+1)=23Note: Both the sack should be non-empty.A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. An array that is inside another array.A coin can be inserted in one and only one sacks i.e you cannot choose a coin more than one time.
