..N1 ... N. Every person ii, except for the founder of the family (root) has a parent denoted by P[i]P[i]. P[root]P[root] = -1 by definition. Person ii is a descendant of person jj if ii belongs to the subtree rooted at jj.The net worth (adjusted for inflation) is given for all the members of the family. Your task is to find the maximum difference in net worth\'s of two members where one member is a descendant of the other.    You can assume that no two members of this family married each other. So it remains a "family tree".
