NNN players advance to the fifth round and the game is going to be Hopscotch. Every player has to select one mannequin before the start of the game.Players are numbered 111 to NNN. You are given an array AAA of size NNN, where    If Ai=iAi=iA_i = i, the ithithi^{\\text{th}} player selects their own mannequin.If Ai=jAi=jA_i = j where j\xe2\x89\xa0ij\xe2\x89\xa0ij \eq i, the ithithi^{\\text{th}} player decides the mannequin for the jthjthj^{\\text{th}} player.If Ai=0Ai=0A_i = 0, the ithithi^{\\text{th}} player hasn\xe2\x80\x99t decided yet.The VIPs want to know the number of ways that the undecided players can select mannequins such that everyone gets a mannequin, and no undecided players select their own mannequin.It is guaranteed that every (non-zero) element in AAA is unique, i.e, if 1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N1\xe2\x89\xa4i,j\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\leq i, j \\leq N are such that i\xe2\x89\xa0j,Ai>0i\xe2\x89\xa0j,Ai>0i \eq j, A_i > 0, and Aj>0Aj>0A_j > 0, then Ai\xe2\x89\xa0AjAi\xe2\x89\xa0AjA_i \eq A_j.Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
