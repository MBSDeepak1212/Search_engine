" The god had blessed him with only one thing ever, his IQ (Intelligence Quotient). He has the IQ NNN.God Taran had some mercy on him and granted him a superpower, that he can share his IQ with anyone and make him is friend. Formally, God Taran gave him an array BBB of length KKK. Vijju can partition his IQ into KKK parts represented by array AAA, with condition that 0\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]0\xe2\x89\xa4A[i]\xe2\x89\xa4B[i]0 \\leq A[i] \\leq B[i]. If A[i]>B[i]A[i]>B[i]A[i]>B[i], he will invite wrath of Mighty Taran, something he\'s deeply scared of and wants to avoid.But, having high IQ, Vijju thinks the number of ways he can do so, without attracting Wrath of Lord Taran.Vijju found this answer, but he ask you to verify his answer by solving this problem.Two Partitions A1A1A_1 and A2A2A_2 differ if A1[i]\xe2\x89\xa0A2[i]A1[i]\xe2\x89\xa0A2[i]A_1 [i] \eq A_2 [i] for any position i.Vijju knows this problem is not for people with less IQ, so he ask you to find answer modulo 109+9109+910^9+9.
