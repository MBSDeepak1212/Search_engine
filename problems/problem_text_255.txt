There's an N\xc3\x97NN\xc3\x97NN \\times N grid where each cell of the grid contains a positive integer. Let Vi,jVi,jV_{i,j} be the positive integer on the cell positioned iii-th rows from the top and jjj-th columns from the left.Initially, Alice is at position (Ax,Ay)(Ax,Ay)(A_x, A_y) and Bob is at (Bx,By)(Bx,By)(B_x, B_y). Both players can move like a chess king on the grid: one step horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They can't move out of the grid or stay in the same cell. Alice starts with an initial score of 000. The game proceeds as follows:Alice moves to a neighboring cell of her choice (horizontally, vertically or diagonally). Her score increases by the integer on the cell she just moved to.If Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else Bob moves to a neighboring cell of his choice.If Alice and Bob are in the same cell, then the game ends, else go to step 1.The goal of Alice is to maximize her score. The goal of Bob is to minimize Alice's score. Both players play optimally. It can be proven that the game will end in a finite number of iterations.You need to find the maximum score Alice can achieve. Note: Over the course of the game, Alice can revisit cells multiple times. She gets the corresponding value added to her score each time she visits it.
