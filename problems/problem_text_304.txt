 In order to learn they give themselves a task. In this task they are given a string and they have to form a pyramid with the pattern as follows:RowNumber are one based indexed.If (RowNumber % 3 == 0) then string is written in left to right while in other cases it is written in right to left order.if the string end it will be started again and end of the pyramid need not to be the end of string.For eg: string is \xe2\x80\x9cCODINGCODINGCODING\xe2\x80\x9d and height of pyramid is \xe2\x80\x9c555\xe2\x80\x9d          C         D O        I N G       I D O C      D O C G NOmi will be asked QQQ queries and he has to tell the frequency of a character  C in that particular row RRR of pyramid.
