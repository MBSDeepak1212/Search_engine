Chefland is inhabited by chefs, which have only one gender. Each chef can, alone, give birth to many younger chefs, which can then give birth to even younger chefs, and so on. It is easy to see that the family structure of any chef (formed by this chef's direct and indirect descendants) is a tree.A family is a tree such that its root does not have a parent, i.e. it is not a proper subtree of any tree. In a valid family tree, the age of each chef that has a parent is strictly smaller than the age of this chef's parent. The respect of a family is the age of the oldest chef in this family. The respect of Chefland is the sum of respects of all families in Chefland.A long time ago, there were several families in Chefland. All their data was stored in the Cookbook; the families were represented by listing all the (undirected) edges in all family trees and the ages of all chefs. Since all family trees were valid, it was always possible to deduce the exact parent-child relations.Over many years, the book got contaminated \xe2\x80\x94 people added some extra edges (possibly zero) between some chefs. Currently, there are NNN chefs in the book (numbered 111 through NNN; note that no chefs were added) and MMM undirected edges between them.Young Chef is now wondering: what could the respect of Chefland have been, as originally described in the Cookbook? Consider all ways to remove a (possibly empty) set of edges such that the resulting graph contains only valid families. For each possible kkk, find the sum of respects of Chefland over all the ways such that the resulting graph contains exactly kkk families. Since these numbers may be large, compute them modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
