From the cell (0, 0), our knight has to move to the cell (X, Y) by the rule:our knight could only move from a cell (u, v) to the cell (u+AX, v+AY) or (u+BX, v+BY) in one move.Note that it may be different from ordinary knight\'s move of chess.In addition, there is K blocked cell(s) on the table where the knight could not move on.Your task is to count how many distinct ways the knight could complete his mission.Two ways are called "distinct" if and only if they have different numbers of steps or there exists i such that they are in different cells after i-th step.Note that our knight may continue to move after he reaches the cell (X, Y).
