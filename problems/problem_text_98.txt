Chef has a string AA with length NN. It contains only characters '(', ')' and '*'. Chef wants to perform the following process:Uniformly randomly choose a pair of integers (l,r)(l, r) such that 1\xe2\x89\xa4l\xe2\x89\xa4r\xe2\x89\xa4N1 \\le l \\le r \\le N.Consider the substring S=[Al,Al+1,\xe2\x80\xa6,Ar]S = [A_l, A_{l+1}, \\ldots, A_r]. Process the characters of this string from left to right.Let's denote the current number of closing brackets in SS up to the currently processed character (inclusive) by ncn_c. Similarly, let's denote the number of opening brackets by non_o. Note that the string SS may change; ncn_c and non_o correspond to the current state of SS, not its initial state.Whenever ncn_c becomes greater than non_o, the currently processed character must be ')'. Then, change it from ')' to '(' and continue processing the remaining characters of SS.Chef would like to know the expected number of characters that he would change in this process. Can you help him?It can be proved that this expected value can be expressed as a fraction P/QP/Q, where PP and QQ are non-negative integers and QQ is coprime to 109+710^9+7. You should find P\xe2\x8b\x85Q\xe2\x88\x921P \\cdot Q^{-1} modulo 109+710^9+7, where Q\xe2\x88\x921Q^{-1} denotes the multiplicative inverse of QQ modulo 109+710^9+7.
