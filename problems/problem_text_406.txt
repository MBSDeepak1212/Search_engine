 A subset of these houses SSS is called a city if any house in SSS is reachable from any other house in SSS. Formally, a subset of houses SSS is a city if xxx and yyy are reachable from each other for all x,y\xe2\x88\x88Sx,y\xe2\x88\x88Sx, y \\in S. The funding required for a city SSS consisting of kkk houses is defined as k2k2k^2.The president has given the mayor Saarang an order: divide the country into 222 cities with exactly one road connecting them. In other words, divide the country into two cities S1S1S_1 and S2S2S_2 such that:Each house iii either belongs to S1S1S_1 or S2S2S_2.There exists a single road connect a house xxx from S1S1S_1 and a house yyy from S2S2S_2.For this purpose, you are allowed to build more bi-directional roads. The funding required to build a road between any 222 houses is ccc.Saarang, however, is busy preparing for his board exams so he requests you to solve this problem for him. Find the minimum total funding required to divide the country per the president's requirements, or \xe2\x88\x921\xe2\x88\x921-1 if no division is possible.Note: The total funding is the sum of the funding required for the 222 cities and the roads built. If after the division, the two cities have xxx and n\xe2\x88\x92xn\xe2\x88\x92xn-x houses respectively and you have built a total of aaa roads, The total funding will be x2+(n\xe2\x88\x92x)2+c\xc3\x97ax2+(n\xe2\x88\x92x)2+c\xc3\x97ax^2 + (n-x)^2 + c \\times a.
