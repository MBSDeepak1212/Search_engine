You are given two integers NN and KK, and an array AA of NN integers. You have to choose KK disjoint non-empty subarrays such that the score is maximized. The score is calculated as follows:Score=K\xe2\x88\x91i=1Sum[i]\xe2\x8b\x85i,\\mathrm{Score}= \\sum_{i=1}^{K} \\mathrm{Sum}[i] \\cdot i,where Sum[i]\\mathrm{Sum}[i] denotes sum of elements of ii-th subarray. By the ii-th subarray, we mean the ii-th one in the order from left to right.Find the maximum score that can be achieved.Note: The subarrays are not required to cover the whole array. It is allowed for some elements of AA to belong to none of the subarrays.
