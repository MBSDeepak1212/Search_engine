 Now, Farzi Coder has done coding his project and has to submit it to a central git repository.    In git, before committing we have to add the files which we want to commit to the stage. We can add (stage) or remove (unstage) files to/from the stage. Initially the stage is empty.Programmer Bhai is very particular about what goes into the repository and what doesn't. He has given a list of files alongwith whether he wants the file in the stage or not.    e.g.        stage /code/lib/acpp    stage /code/lib/bcpp    unstage /code/lib/aout        This means we want /code/lib/acpp and /code/lib/bcpp to be in the stage while /code/lib/aout should not be in the stage.    There are 2 git commands to control staging:    git add <path>    git remove <path>        The path here can be a path to a file or a path to a directory. If the path is to a directory, the command applies to all the files and subdirectories inside that directory recursively. Farzi Coder wants to commit the code asap.    What is the minimum number of git commands needed to add all the required files to stage while making sure none of the unstage files are in the stage.
