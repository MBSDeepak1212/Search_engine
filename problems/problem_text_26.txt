He knows that there are N different questions that will be on the tests. For each question i (i = 1..N), he knows C[i] - the number of tests that will contain this question, P[i] - the number of points that he will get for correctly answering this question on each of tests and T[i] - the amount of time (in minutes) that he needs to spend to learn this question.Unfortunately, the amount of free time that Polo has is limited to W minutes. Help him to find the maximal possible total number of points he can get for all tests if he studies for no more than W minutes.
