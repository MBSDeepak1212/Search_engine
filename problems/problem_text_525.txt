Consider a rooted tree. A leaf in this tree is a vertex that does not have any children. Suppose that we perform a depth-first search from the root and write down the numbers of all leaves in the order in which they are visited. Since the order of visiting the sons of any vertex during the search is not fixed, many different sequences of leaves may be created. We call a subset of all leaves good if it is non-empty and there is at least one sequence of leaves such that the leaves from this subset (in some order) form its contiguous subsequence.You are given a tree with NNN vertices numbered 111 through NNN. You should answer QQQ queries. In each query, you are given a vertex RRR and a set of leaves SSS; you should find out whether SSS is a good set when the tree is rooted at RRR.
