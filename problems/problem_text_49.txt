Chef has a tree GGG with NNN nodes (numbered 11 through NN) and N\xe2\x88\x921N-1 undirected edges. For each node uu in the tree, he can assign directions to the edges in such a way that uu is reachable from all the other nodes. Let CuC_u be the number of valid topological orderings in the resulting directed acyclic graph.This way, Chef obtains NN pairs (C1,1),(C2,2),\xe2\x80\xa6,(CN,N)(C_1,1), (C_2,2), \\ldots, (C_N,N) and he sorts all these pairs (Ci,i)(C_i, i) in descending order (first by CiC_i and in the case of a tie by ii). For example, consider the tree below:The sorted list of pairs is ((2,2),(1,3),(1,1))((2,2), (1,3), (1,1)).Chef quizzes you on this list \xe2\x80\x95 he wants you to find the KK-th pair in the sorted list. To make that task easier, Chef only asks for K=1K = 1 (the largest pair) or K=2K = 2 (the second largest pair). Since the number of topological orderings can be very large, compute it modulo 109+710^9+7.
