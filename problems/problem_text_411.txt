Chef is a cook. He has a son Chefu and a daughter Chefa. He also has NNN coins, numbered 111 through NNN; for each valid iii, the iii-th coin has value ViViV_i.Chef wants to give all coins to his two children in the following way: He traverses all coins in a particular order; for each coin, he checks which child currently has less money in total and gives this coin to that child (if both have the same amount of money, Chefu is given the coin).Chefu is studying computer science, so he knows that this method is not necessarily the most fair way of partitioning the coins, but Chef does not understand why, since he is only a cook.Now, Chefu wants to take advantage of that and choose the order in which Chef should give out the coins in such a way that the amount of money he gets is maximised. Can you help him?
