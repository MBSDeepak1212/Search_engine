 Every node have value equal to zero initially , Let's call it version 1. You will be given Q queries of two type:-111 ver1ver1ver1 ver2ver2ver2 vvv ccc You have to make version ver2ver2ver2 from version ver1ver1ver1 by adding value ccc in subtree of vertex vvv at alternate levels , starting from level of vertex vvv.222 ver1ver1ver1 vvvYou have to tell value of vertex vvv in version ver1ver1ver1It is guaranteed that in query , version ver1ver1ver1 already exist and version ver2ver2ver2 does not exist .
