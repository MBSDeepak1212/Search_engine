Chef's friend Aayan loves Ghariyals (those long-mouthed crocodile like creatures). Chef's other friend, Mr. KG, knows about this love of Aayan's. So one day, he gives Aayan an interesting problem:Mr. KG gives Aayan a table A of N rows and M columns filled with non-negative integers. The rows and colums of the table are indexed starting from 1. A[i][j] denotes the j'th integer in the i'th row of A.Let's consider some sequence (i1, j1), (i2, j2), ..., (iK, jK)(1 \xe2\x89\xa4 K) of the table cells. A sequence of table cells is said to be a valid Ghariyal-path if all of the following conditions holds:(i1, j1) equals to (1, 1) - the top-left cell of the table  (iK, jK) equals to (N, M) - the bottom-right cell of the table  it \xe2\x89\xa4 it + 1 for each integer 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t < Kjt \xe2\x89\xa4 jt + 1 for each integer 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t < K|it + 1 - it| + |jt + 1 - jt| = 1 for each integer 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 t < KOne can easily prove that the length of any valid Ghariyal-path is exactly N + M - 1 cells. It's also easy to prove that any valid Ghariyal-path contains any of the table cells at most once.Mr. KG asked Aayan to cover the given table with valid Ghariyal-paths. To be precise, his task is to find the minimal number of valid Ghariyal-paths such that for any table cell with coordinates (i, j) the following condition is satisfied: at least A[i][j] valid Ghariyal-paths contain the (i, j)-cell.
