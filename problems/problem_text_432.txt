You are given a table with NNN rows and MMM columns. Let's denote the cell in row rrr and column ccc by (r,c)(r,c)(r, c). You are also given QQQ rectangles in this table.Consider a directed acyclic graph such that each vertex corresponds to a cell of the table (so there are N\xe2\x8b\x85MN\xe2\x8b\x85MN \\cdot M vertices) and there is an edge from cell (r1,c1)(r1,c1)(r_1, c_1) to cell (r2,c2)(r2,c2)(r_2, c_2) if and only if:r1<r2,c1<c2r1<r2,c1<c2r_1 < r_2, c_1 < c_2there is a rectangle containing cells (r1,c1)(r1,c1)(r_1, c_1) and (r2,c2)(r2,c2)(r_2, c_2)Let's define the length of a path as the number of vertices it contains. Find the length of the longest path and the number of different paths with maximum length in this graph. Two paths are different if their lengths are different or there is a cell which is visited in one path, but not in the other. Since the number of paths can be large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
