 She wanted to see how clever Saitama was.  Hence she asked him a question. Saitama was given a list of numbers by his date, let the list be N=[a1,a2,a3........an].N=[a1,a2,a3........an].N = [a1,a2,a3 ........ an].Saitama's task is to find out how many elements in the list is made up by combining other numbers from the list. He can combine a number A more than once to form number B. Your task is to help Saitama in his endeavour and help him count the number of numbers in the list which were formed by combining other numbers present in the list. Note: You cannot rearrange the digits of the number.
