 Specifically, if M=1M=1M = 1, then f(X)=0f(X)=0f(X) = 0.For e.g., f([3,1,7,2])=|1\xe2\x88\x923|+|7\xe2\x88\x921|+|2\xe2\x88\x927|=13f([3,1,7,2])=|1\xe2\x88\x923|+|7\xe2\x88\x921|+|2\xe2\x88\x927|=13f([3, 1, 7, 2]) = |1-3| + |7-1| + |2-7| = 13JJ has an array AAA of length NNN. He wants to divide the array AAA into two subsequences PPP and QQQ (possibly empty) such that the value of f(P)+f(Q)f(P)+f(Q)f(P) + f(Q) is as large as possible. (Note that each AiAiA_i must belong to either subsequence PPP or subsequence QQQ).Help him find this maximum value of f(P)+f(Q)f(P)+f(Q)f(P) + f(Q).Note: A sequence XXX is a subsequence of a sequence YYY if XXX can be obtained from YYY by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
