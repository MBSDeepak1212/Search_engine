A partitioning of the array AAA is the splitting of AAA into one or more non-empty contiguous subarrays such that each element of AAA belongs to exactly one of these subarrays.Find the number of ways to partition AAA such that the parity of the sum of elements within the subarrays is alternating. In other words, if SiSiS_i denotes the sum of the elements in the iii-th subarray, then eitherS1S1S_1 is odd, S2S2S_2 is even, S3S3S_3 is odd and so on.or S1S1S_1 is even, S2S2S_2 is odd, S3S3S_3 is even and so on.For example if A=[1,2,3,3,5]A=[1,2,3,3,5]A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 5]. One way to partition AAA is [1,2][3,3][5][1,2][3,3][5][1, 2] [3, 3] [5]. Another way to partition AAA is [1][2][3][3,5][1][2][3][3,5][1] [2] [3] [3, 5]. Note that there exists more ways to partition this array.Since the answer may be large, output it modulo 998244353998244353998244353.
