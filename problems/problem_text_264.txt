You have a tree consisting of N vertices numbered 1 to N.Initially each edge has a value equal to zero. You have to first perform M1 operations and then answer M2 queries. Note you have to first perform all the operations and then answer all queries after all operations have been done.Operations are defined by:A B C D: On the path between nodes numbered A and B increase the value of each edge by 1, except for those edges which occur on the path between C and D. Note that there is an unique path between every pair of nodes ie. we don't consider values on edges for finding the path. All four values given in input will be distinct.Queries are of the following type:E F: Print the sum of values of all the edges on the path between two distinct nodes E and F. Again the path will be unique.
