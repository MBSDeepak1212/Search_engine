 Fluffy thinks that a sequence b1b1b_{1}, b2b2b_{2}, \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\\ldots, bkbkb_{k} is alternating if and only if either of the following holds :For all iii, bi<bi+1bi<bi+1b_{i} < b_{i + 1} if and only if iii is oddFor all iii, bi<bi+1bi<bi+1b_{i} < b_{i + 1} if and only if iii is evenFor example, 111,444,222,555,333 and 444,111,555,222,333 are both alternating sequences.A subsequence of a sequence is a sequence that is formed by deleting zero or more elements of the original sequence. For example, 333, 444, 555 is a subsequence of 111, 333, 222, 444, 777, 666, 555. Flippy the bird has asked Fluffy to find the longest alternating subsequence of the array aaa, but there are so many of them, so he also wants to know the number of longest alternating subsequences. Can you help him?
