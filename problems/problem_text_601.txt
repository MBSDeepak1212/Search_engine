 But, can you believe it? His new phone just crashed and all of the words are missing from its dictionary! There used to be NNN words in there, and he certainly doesn\'t have time to add all of them back right now.His plan is to just choose KKK distinct words of the NNN possible words, add them to the phone\'s dictionary, and then text each of them. To text a certain word, he must either type the word itself, or any nonempty prefix of it which is not a prefix of any other word in the dictionary.Can you help chef find out the minimum number of letters he must type to send the message of KKK words?
