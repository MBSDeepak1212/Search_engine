 The work is complex and requires the company to hire different categories of highly skilled laborers at different times for different parts of the work. An analysis of the whole project showed that K different groups of highly skilled laborers are needed for K subparts of the project, each of which takes a certain number of days. \xc2\xa0The subparts are numbered from 1 to K.The whole work is supervised by a consultant of the company and he can supervise only one subpart at a time, so only one group of skilled laborers is actually utilized at one time. However, it is very difficult to find skilled labor just when you need them, so in order to avoid delays due to non-availability of required labor when it is needed, the company decides to hire all skilled laborers at the start of the project itself, paying them from the beginning of the project till their subpart is done, at which time, they are let go. Each such group costs the company a certain amount of money per day from the day they are hired till the day they finish their part.The situation is compounded by the fact that some of these subparts have to be done in order. However, it is seen that any subpart can be dependent on at most one other subpart and can cause at most one other subpart to be dependent on it.What is the minimum total amount the company has to pay to the laborers?
