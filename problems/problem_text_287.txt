Your friend works as a valet where NNN cars show up in a shift. The iii-th car will arrive TiTiT_i seconds after the current moment, and the car can wait for at most YiYiY_i seconds. That is, your friend can only start parking the car from time TiTiT_i to Ti+YiTi+YiT_i+Y_i (inclusive).Additionally, it takes XiXiX_i time to park the iii-th car, which means he cannot park any other cars for XiXiX_i seconds starting from the time he starts parking the iii-th car. It is known that no driver would like to wait for more time than it takes to park his car, so that Yi<XiYi<XiY_i  < X_i for all iii. The driver of the iii-th car will pay AiAiA_i coins as a tip to your friend if his car is parked. Note that he can start parking the next car immediately after he finishes parking the previous car.Your friend has asked you what will be the maximize possible earnings if he optimally chooses which cars to park and at what times.
