Ridbit is given an array a1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa1,a2,\xe2\x80\xa6,aNa_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_N. He needs to find the number of ways to divide the array into contiguous subarrays such that:Each element of the sequence aa belongs to exactly one of the subarrays.There is an integer mm such that the MEX of every subarray is equal to mm. The MEX of a sequence is the smallest non-negative integer which does not occur in this sequence.Help Ridbit with this task.
