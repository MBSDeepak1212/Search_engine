 Of course, they are very lazy and have handed it over to you as a part of Social Community service.You have 222 types of mining bombs (in unlimited quantity) and you have to mine a row of size 1\xe2\x88\x97N1\xe2\x88\x97N1 * N (you can say NNN cells), drawn on the ground (of course, other areas are mined by other students and their work will not affect your row, so youshouldn't be bothered with them).But the mining bombs are of very cheap quality, obviously as expected from the administration.The 1st type of bombs mine only the cell they are dropped and the very next cell on the right.The 2nd type of bombs mine only the cell they are dropped and the very next two cells on the right.You are not allowed to drop a bomb at a position which is already mined as the administration wants all gold for themselves and they think, if an area is mined twice the gold may be exposed and you may take some of it.Also, you cannot drop a bomb at a position if its mining range goes out of the NNN cells, else it will affect the nearby hostels.You need to find the number of ways you can mine the row allotted to you with the given types of bombs.As the final answer may be too long, you are required to output the answer modulo 1000000007 (109+7109+710^9 + 7).
