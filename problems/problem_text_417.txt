 The color of each node is either Black or White.In one step, you can choose a node uuu, toggle the color of the chosen node uuu, as well as toggle the colors of all the nodes vvv, such that {u,v}{u,v}\\{u, v\\} is an edge in the tree.Can you find out the minimum number of steps required to make the color of all the nodes black?Note: Since the input is large, prefer using fast input methods.
