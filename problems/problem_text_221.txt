Chef invented a new game named Quick Battle Royale. NNN people play the game. One or more rounds are played until all players except one are eliminated. In each round:Let there be xxx non-eliminated players at the start of the round. Let's number them 111 through xxx.First, each of these players chooses an integer between 111 and xxx inclusive. For each valid iii, let's denote the integer chosen by the iii-th player by pipip_i. In addition, each player is not allowed to choose pi=ipi=ip_i = i. Under these conditions, all players choose uniformly randomly and independently.Then, the elimination process starts. For each iii from 111 to xxx, in this order:if the player iii is currently still in the game, the player pipip_i is eliminated from the game immediatelyif the player iii was already eliminated from the game in this round, nothing happensNote that it is impossible for all players to be eliminated and in each round, at least one player is eliminated.For example, a game for N=4N=4N = 4 could look like this:Round 1: The players choose p1=3p1=3p_1 = 3, p2=4p2=4p_2 = 4, p3=2p3=2p_3 = 2, p4=2p4=2p_4 = 2. For i=1i=1i = 1, since player 111 is still in the game, player pi=3pi=3p_i = 3 is eliminated. For i=2i=2i = 2, since player 222 is also in the game, player pi=4pi=4p_i = 4 is eliminated. Since the players 333 and 444 are eliminated, nothing more happens.Round 2: Two players remain. The only choice they have is p1=2p1=2p_1 = 2 and p2=1p2=1p_2 = 1. For i=1i=1i = 1, since player 111 is still in the game, player pi=2pi=2p_i = 2 gets eliminated. For i=2i=2i = 2, player 222 is eliminated, so nothing happens.Now there is one player left, so the game ends. It lasted 222 rounds.You have to find the expected value of the number of rounds the game will last. It can be shown that the expected number of rounds can be written as a fraction pqpq\\frac{p}{q}, where ppp and qqq are positive integers and qqq is coprime with 109+7109+710^9+7. You have to compute p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921p\xe2\x8b\x85q\xe2\x88\x921p \\cdot q^{-1} modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7, where q\xe2\x88\x921q\xe2\x88\x921q^{-1} is the multiplicative inverse of qqq modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
