Let's call an integer sequence nice if the sum of its elements is divisible by a given integer KKK. You are given an integer sequence A1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA1,A2,\xe2\x80\xa6,ANA_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N. Hasan wanted to find the number of nice subsequences of this sequence. However, this problem is too easy, so Hasan decided to add an extra constraint. For an arbitrary non-empty sequence of indices i1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<iLi1<i2<\xe2\x80\xa6<iLi_1 \\lt i_2 \\lt \\ldots \\lt i_L, let's call a subsequence Ai1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AiLAi1,Ai2,\xe2\x80\xa6,AiLA_{i_1}, A_{i_2}, \\ldots, A_{i_L} very nice if it is nice and iL\xe2\x88\x92i1\xe2\x89\xa5WiL\xe2\x88\x92i1\xe2\x89\xa5Wi_L-i_1 \\ge W. Help Hasan and find the number of very nice subsequences. Since this number may be very large, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.
