 He realized that the lyrics of many songs contain the same words. He thought of a task to do in his leisure; pick a set of words and find the frequency of the words in the lyrics of various songs.A word A from the lyrics is said to match a given word W if W is a substring of A.Note Some words from the lyrics can match multiple given words. For e.g, shawty, matches both shawty as well as hawt. The word shawty in the lyrics must be counted in the frquency of shawty as well as hawt.You may assume that all the comparisons must be case sensitive. Also, there are no whitespaces within a word in the given list, or in the lyrics. Words in the lyrics are separated by "-" characters (of course without the quotes).
