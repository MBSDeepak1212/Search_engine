 You are trying to find a subset of this set such that no two numbers in the subset have a common digit. There will of course be several such subsets. You are interested in the subset with the maximum sum. The sum of a subset is defined as the sum of the numbers in the subset.In fact, you are most interested in the cardinality - that is, the number of elements - of the subset with the maximum sum. Of course there may be several such subsets with the same maximum sum. Find the cardinality of the subset with the most elements among such sets.Refer to the explanation section for more clarity.
