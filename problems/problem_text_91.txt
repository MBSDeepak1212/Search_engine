An array AA consisting of NN integers is called KK-beautiful if it holds the following property:The number of adjacent indices with different values is at most KK. More formally, there are at most KK indices ii (1\xe2\x89\xa4i<N1\\le i\\lt N) such that Ai\xe2\x89\xa0Ai+1A_i\e A_{i+1}. Note that according to this definition, if an array AA is KK-beautiful, then AA is also (K+1)(K+1)-beautiful.You are given an array AA consisting of NN integers and an integer KK. Find the length of the longest KK-beautiful subsequence of AA, where a subsequence is defined below.For example, consider the array A=[1,1,2,3,2,4]A = [1 , 1, 2, 3, 2 , 4]. The subsequences [1,1][1, 1] and [1,1,2][1, 1, 2] are 11-beautiful, and the subsequences [1,2,3][1, 2, 3] and [1,2,2,4][1, 2, 2, 4] are 22-beautiful.Note: A sequence aa is a subsequence of a sequence bb if aa can be obtained from bb by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, [3,1][3,1] is a subsequence of [3,2,1][3,2,1] and [4,3,1][4,3,1], but not a subsequence of [1,3,3,7][1,3,3,7] and [3,10,4][3,10,4].
