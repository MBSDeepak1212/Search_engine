Now you sell broomsticks of various lengths. You initially do not have any brooms.You decide to roam about in the city finding brooms and selling them.During each of the n days of your work as a brooms seller one of the following two events will happen:1) You may find a broom of length L.You may or may not keep it.2) You may have a customer ask for a broom of length L.You sell broomsticks by the length.Hence if you have the required broom of length L you can sell it in L rupees.The only problem is that you have a bad memory hence cant remember the sizes of more than 1 broom hence you never keep more than 1 broom with yourself.Now if you are given the events of those n days in advance, write a program to figure out the maximum amount you can earn..\xc2\xa0
