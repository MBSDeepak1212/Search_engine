Shortly after joining the Parliament, our Chef has been elected as the new Prime Minister. Now, being the PM, he can do one good or bad deed per day. Initially, Chef has a reputation with his cabinet equal to 000; when he does a good deed, his reputation increases by 111 and when he does a bad deed, his reputation decreases by 111.Chef plans to do exactly ppp good deeds and exactly qqq bad deeds. However, to do a bad deed, his reputation must be strictly greater than ccc (before doing this deed) \xe2\x80\x94 otherwise, he would lose the confidence of his cabinet and be forced to resign.DGP Vaibhav has been dealing with corrupt ministers for a long time. In the past, he has arrested MMM corrupt ministers. For each 1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M1\xe2\x89\xa4i\xe2\x89\xa4M1 \\le i \\le M, when the iii-th minister was arrested, that minister had done gigig_i good deeds and bibib_i bad deeds. Over time, Vaibhav has become an expert at detecting and arresting corrupt ministers \xe2\x80\x94 Chef is certain that immediately after he performs exactly gigig_i good deeds and exactly bibib_i bad deeds (for some iii between 111 and MMM inclusive), he will end up arrested by Vaibhav. Since Chef plans to be a good PM, we may assume he won't be arrested by Vaibhav for any other reason.Compute the number of sequences of good and bad deeds Chef can perform in order to execute his plan without getting arrested by Vaibhav or losing the confidence of his cabinet, modulo 109+7109+710^9 + 7.
