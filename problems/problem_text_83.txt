After failing to clear his school mathematics examination, infinitepro decided to prepare very hard for his upcoming re-exam, starting with the topic he is weakest at \xe2\x80\x95 computational geometry.Being an artist, infinitepro has CCC pencils (numbered 11 through CC); each of them draws with one of CC distinct colours. He draws NN lines (numbered 11 through NN) in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system; for each valid ii, the ii-th line is drawn with the cic_i-th pencil and it is described by the equation y=ai\xe2\x8b\x85x+biy = a_i \\cdot x + b_i.Now, infinitepro calls a triangle truly-geometric if each of its sides is part of some line he drew and all three sides have the same colour. He wants to count these triangles, but there are too many of them! After a lot of consideration, he decided to erase a subset of the NN lines he drew. He wants to do it with his eraser, which has length KK.Whenever erasing a line with a colour ii, the length of the eraser decreases by ViV_i. In other words, when the eraser has length kk and we use it to erase a line with a colour ii, the length of the eraser decreases to k\xe2\x88\x92Vik-V_i; if k<Vik \\lt V_i, it is impossible to erase such a line.Since infinitepro has to study for the re-exam, he wants to minimise the number of truly-geometric triangles. Can you help him find the minimum possible number of truly-geometric triangles which can be obtained by erasing a subset of the NN lines in an optimal way? He promised a grand treat for you if he passes the examination!
