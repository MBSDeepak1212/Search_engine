..ANA_1, A_2, ... A_N The game is played as follows.If all the numbers are equal, the game ends.OtherwiseSelect two numbers which are unequalSubtract the smaller number from the larger numberReplace the larger number with the result from aboveChef has already figured out that the game always terminates. He also knows, for a given sequence of integers, the game will always terminate on the same value, no matter how the game is played. Chef wants you to simulate the game for him and tell him if the game terminates on 11.In fact, there may be many such games. Given a sequence of integers Chef wants to know the number of sub-sequences of the given sequence, for which, playing the above game on the subsuquence will terminate on 11. A sub-sequence can be obtained from the original sequence by deleting 00 or more integers from the original sequence. See the explanation section for clarity.
