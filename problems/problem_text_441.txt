There's no story in this problem, it's time for trees!The company structure of ShareChat can be viewed as a tree with NNN nodes (numbered 111 through NNN); node 111 is the root of this tree. You should choose a (possibly empty) subset of nodes and place one coin in each node from this set. We call the tree proper if the following condition holds:Consider two arbitrary disjont subtrees. Let's denote the total number of coins in one subtree by XXX and the total number of coins in the other subtree by YYY.If X>0X>0X > 0 and Y>0Y>0Y > 0, the greatest common divisior (GCD) of XXX and YYY must be 111.Please calculate the number of different assignments of coins to nodes (different sets of nodes containing coins) such that the resulting tree is proper. Since the answer could be very big, compute it modulo 109+7109+710^9+7.Note: A subtree is the tree formed by some node vvv and all (direct or indirect) descendants of vvv. Two subtrees are disjont if they do not have any common node.
