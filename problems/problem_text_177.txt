Problem descriptionRudreshwar likes random numbers and random arrays. Today Rudreshwar started playing with a couple of Arrays A and B, each of size N.Initially A is filled with zeros. Rudreshwar filled B with random numbers.Rudreshwar visits each index i (1 <= i <= N) in random order. When at i, he selects another random index j such that j is greater or equal to i. He then increments A[i], A[i+1], A[i+2] ... A[j] by 1.Finally if for any index i, A[i] is greater than B[i], he then throws away that array AFor a given B, calculate the number of different arrays A, that Rudreshwar can end up with. Two arrays are called different if there exists an index where the arrays have different values
